# How to Create a Module

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a module, test the module, publish it to NPM, and install it in a Medusa backend.

This document covers the general steps of creating the module, but does not explore actually implementing any functionality in it.

## Prerequisites

If you wish to follow the steps to publish the module on NPM, you’ll need an [NPM account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) to publish the module on.

---

## Step 1: Create an NPM Project

Since modules are installed in the Medusa backend (or other NPM projects) using NPM, you must create an NPM project that will hold your module.

If you don’t have one already created, run the following commands to create a directory and initialize an NPM project in it:

```bash npm2yarn
mkdir my-module
npm init
```

You’ll be asked a couple of questions related to your package, such as its name or license. You can keep the default for now or set them right away.

Once you’re done, you should have a `package.json` created in the directory.

---

## Step 2: Changes to package.json

In your `package.json` file, add or update the following fields:

```json
{
  // other fields
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
  "files": [
    "dist"
  ],
  "devDependencies": {
    "@medusajs/types": "^0.0.2",
    "cross-env": "^5.2.1",
    "typescript": "^4.4.4"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "tsc --build --watch",
    "prepare": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production npm run build",
    "build": "tsc --build",
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@medusajs/medusa": "^1.7.13"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@medusajs/modules-sdk": "^0.1.0",
  }
}
```

This adds the necessary dependencies for your development, including the `@medusajs/modules-sdk` package. It also adds the following scripts that will help you during your development of the module:

- `watch`: can be used to re-build your module whenever any changes occur without having to manually trigger the `build`.
- `prepare`: can be used to prepare your module for publishing on NPM
- `build`: can be used to manually build your module.

---

## Step 3: Add tsconfig.json

In the root of your NPM project, create the file `tsconfig.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": [
      "es5",
      "es6",
      "es2019"
    ],
    "target": "es5",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "downlevelIteration": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": [
    "dist",
    "./src/**/__tests__",
    "./src/**/__mocks__",
    "./src/**/__fixtures__",
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

This allows you to use the recommended TypeScript configurations and sets the output directory to `dist`. This is essential for preparing your module for testing and publishing.

---

## Step 4: Implement the Custom Functionality

This step depends on what you’re actually implementing. For example, you can implement the cache or events module, or you can implement a commerce module. If what you’re creating has a guide, you can refer to it while implementing the functionalities.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '#',
    label: 'Create a Cache Module',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to create a cache module in Medusa.',
      isSoon: true
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '#',
    label: 'Create an Events Module',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to create an events module in Medusa.',
      isSoon: true
    }
  },
]} />

All implementation falls under this step. The next steps instruct you on what to do after you’re done implementing.

---

## Step 5: Test your Module

This step explains how you can test your module in a locally installed [Medusa backend](../backend/install.mdx) after or while implementing your custom functionality.

Run the following command in the root of your module directory:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

Then, register your package locally to use it in other NPM projects with the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm link
```

Next, in your Medusa backend, run the following command to install your module:

```bash npm2yarn
npm link module-name
```

Where `module-name` is the name of your module as defined in the `package.json` of your module.

Finally, add your module to `medusa-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  modules: { 
    // ...
    moduleType: {
      resolve: "<module_name>", 
      options: {
        // options if necessary
      }
    },
  }
};
```

The way you add your module depends on its type and what options it requires, if any. Note that in the above code example:

- `moduleType` is the type of your module. For example, if your module is a cache module, it should be changed to `cacheService`.
- `<module_name>` is the name of your module as defined in the `package.json` of your module.
- `options` should hold any options of your module, if necessary.

You can now test it out simply by running the Medusa backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run start
```

---

## Step 6: Publish Module

This section explains how to publish your module to NPM.

### Run Prepare Command

Before you publish or update your module, make sure to run the `prepare` command defined earlier:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run prepare
```

### Login

In your terminal, log in with your NPM account:

```bash
npm login
```

You’ll be asked to enter your NPM email and password.

### Publish Module Package

Once you’re logged in, you can publish your package with the following command:

```bash
npm publish
```

Your package is then published on NPM and everyone can use it and install it.

### Install Module

To install your published module, you can run the following command on any Medusa backend project:

```bash
npm install module-name
```

Where `module-name` is the name of your module.

### Update Module

To update your module at a later point, you can run the following command to change the NPM version:

```bash
npm version <type>
```

Where `<type>` indicates the type of version update you’re publishing. For example, it can be `major` or `minor`. You can see the [full list of types in NPM’s documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version).

Then, publish the new update:

```bash
npm publish
```
