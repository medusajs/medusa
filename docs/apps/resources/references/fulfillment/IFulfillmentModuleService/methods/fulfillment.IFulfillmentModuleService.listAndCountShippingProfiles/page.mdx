# listAndCountShippingProfiles - Fulfillment Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listAndCountShippingProfiles` method. This belongs to the Fulfillment Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of shipping profiles along with the total count of available shipping profiles satisfying the provided filters.

## Example

To retrieve a list of shipping profiles using their IDs:

```ts
const [shippingProfiles, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountShippingProfiles(
    {
      id: ["sp_123", "sp_321"],
    }
  )
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the shipping profile:

```ts
const [shippingProfiles, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountShippingProfiles(
    {
      id: ["sp_123", "sp_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["shipping_options"],
    }
  )
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const [shippingProfiles, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountShippingProfiles(
    {
      id: ["sp_123", "sp_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["shipping_options"],
      take: 20,
      skip: 2,
    }
  )
```
