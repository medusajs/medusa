# listAndCount - Promotion Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listAndCount` method. This belongs to the Promotion Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of promotions along with the total count of available promotions satisfying the provided filters.

## Example

To retrieve a list of promotions using their IDs:

```ts
const [promotions, count] =
  await promotionModuleService.listAndCount({
    id: ["promo_123", "promo_321"],
  })
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the promotions:

```ts
const [promotions, count] =
  await promotionModuleService.listAndCount(
    {
      id: ["promo_123", "promo_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["application_method"],
    }
  )
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const [promotions, count] =
  await promotionModuleService.listAndCount(
    {
      id: ["promo_123", "promo_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["application_method"],
      take: 20,
      skip: 2,
    }
  )
```
