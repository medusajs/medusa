title: Shipping Profile
description: >-
  A Shipping Profile has a set of defined Shipping Options that can be used to
  fulfill a given set of Products. For example, gift cards are shipped
  differently than physical products, so a shipping profile with the type
  `gift_card` groups together the shipping options that can only be used for
  gift cards.
