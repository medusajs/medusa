# Medusa Storefront API

API reference for Medusa's Storefront endpoints. All endpoints are prefixed with `/store`.

## Authentication

To send requests as an authenticated customer, you must use the Cookie
Session ID.

### Cookie Session ID

Use a cookie session to send authenticated requests.

#### How to Obtain the Cookie Session


If you're sending requests through a browser, using JS Client, or using
tools like Postman, the cookie session should be automatically set when
the customer is logged in.


If you're sending requests using cURL, you must set the Session ID in
the cookie manually.


To do that, send a request to [authenticate the
customer](#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth) and pass the cURL option `-v`:


```bash
curl -v -X POST 'https://medusa-url.com/store/auth' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "supersecret"
}'
```


The headers will be logged in the terminal as well as the response. You
should find in the headers a Cookie header similar to this:


```bash
Set-Cookie:
connect.sid=s%3A2Bu8BkaP9JUfHu9rG59G16Ma0QZf6Gj1.WT549XqX37PN8n0OecqnMCq798eLjZC5IT7yiDCBHPM;
```


Copy the value after `connect.sid` (without the `;` at the end) and pass
it as a cookie in subsequent requests as the following:


```bash
curl 'https://medusa-url.com/store/customers/me/orders' \
-H 'Cookie: connect.sid={sid}'
```


Where `{sid}` is the value of `connect.sid` that you copied.

## Expanding Fields


In many endpoints you'll find an `expand` query parameter that can be passed
to the endpoint. You can use the `expand` query parameter to unpack an
entity's relations and return them in the response.


Please note that the relations you pass to `expand` replace any relations
that are expanded by default in the request.


### Expanding One Relation


For example, when you retrieve a product, you can retrieve its collection by
passing to the `expand` query parameter the value `collection`:


```bash
curl
"http://localhost:9000/store/products/prod_01GDJGP2XPQT2N3JHZQFMH5V45?expand=collection"
```

### Expanding Multiple Relations

You can expand more than one relation by separating the relations in the
`expand` query parameter with a comma.


For example, to retrieve both the variants and the collection of a product,
pass to the `expand` query parameter the value `variants,collection`:


```bash
curl
"http://localhost:9000/store/products/prod_01GDJGP2XPQT2N3JHZQFMH5V45?expand=variants,collection"
```


### Prevent Expanding Relations


Some requests expand relations by default. You can prevent that by passing
an empty expand value to retrieve an entity without any extra relations.


For example:


```bash
curl
"http://localhost:9000/store/products/prod_01GDJGP2XPQT2N3JHZQFMH5V45?expand"
```


This would retrieve the product with only its properties, without any
relations like `collection`.

## Selecting Fields


In many endpoints you'll find a `fields` query parameter that can be passed
to the endpoint. You can use the `fields` query parameter to specify which
fields in the entity should be returned in the response.


Please note that if you pass a `fields` query parameter, only the fields you
pass in the value along with the `id` of the entity will be returned in the
response.


Also, the `fields` query parameter does not affect the expanded relations.
You'll have to use the `expand` parameter instead.


### Selecting One Field


For example, when you retrieve a list of products, you can retrieve only the
titles of the products by passing `title` as a value to the `fields` query
parameter:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?fields=title"
```


As mentioned above, the expanded relations such as `variants` will still be
returned as they're not affected by the `fields` parameter.


You can ensure that only the `title` field is returned by passing an empty
value to the `expand` query parameter. For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?fields=title&expand"
```


### Selecting Multiple Fields


You can pass more than one field by seperating the field names in the
`fields` query parameter with a comma.


For example, to select the `title` and `handle` of a product:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?fields=title,handle"
```


### Retrieve Only the ID


You can pass an empty `fields` query parameter to return only the ID of an
entity. For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?fields"
```


You can also pair with an empty `expand` query parameter to ensure that the
relations aren't retrieved as well. For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?fields&expand"
```

## Query Parameter Types


This section covers how to pass some common data types as query parameters.
This is useful if you're sending requests to the API endpoints and not using
our JS Client. For example, when using cURL or Postman.


### Strings


You can pass a string value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?title=Shirt"
```


If the string has any characters other than letters and numbers, you must
encode them.


For example, if the string has spaces, you can encode the space with `+` or
`%20`:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?title=Blue%20Shirt"
```


You can use tools like [this one](https://www.urlencoder.org/) to learn how
a value can be encoded.

### Integers

You can pass an integer value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?offset=1"
```


### Boolean


You can pass a boolean value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?is_giftcard=true"
```


### Date and DateTime


You can pass a date value in the form `<parameter_name>=<value>`. The date
must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.


For example:


```bash
curl -g "http://localhost:9000/store/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17"
```


You can also pass the time using the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Please
note that the `T` and `Z` here are fixed.


For example:


```bash
curl -g
"http://localhost:9000/store/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17T07:22:30Z"
```


### Array


Each array value must be passed as a separate query parameter in the form
`<parameter_name>[]=<value>`. You can also specify the index of each
parameter in the brackets `<parameter_name>[0]=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl -g
"http://localhost:9000/store/products?sales_channel_id[]=sc_01GPGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7&sales_channel_id[]=sc_234PGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7"
```


Note that the `-g` parameter passed to `curl` disables errors being thrown
for using the brackets. Read more
[here](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-g).


### Object


Object parameters must be passed as separate query parameters in the form
`<parameter_name>[<key>]=<value>`.


For example:


```bash
curl -g
"http://localhost:9000/store/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17&created_at[gt]=2022-09-17"
```

## Pagination


### Query Parameters


In listing endpoints, such as list customers or list products, you can
control the pagination using the query parameters `limit` and `offset`.


`limit` is used to specify the maximum number of items that can be return in
the response. `offset` is used to specify how many items to skip before
returning the resulting entities.


You can use the `offset` query parameter to change between pages. For
example, if the limit is 50, at page 1 the offset should be 0; at page 2 the
offset should be 50, and so on.


For example, to limit the number of products returned in the List Products
endpoint:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?limit=5"
```


### Response Fields


In the response of listing endpoints, aside from the entities retrieved,
there are three pagination-related fields returned: `count`, `limit`, and
`offset`.


Similar to the query parameters, `limit` is the maximum number of items that
can be returned in the response, and `field` is the number of items that
were skipped before the entities in the result.


`count` is the total number of available items of this entity. It can be
used to determine how many pages are there.


For example, if the `count` is 100 and the `limit` is 50, you can divide the
`count` by the `limit` to get the number of pages: `100/50 = 2 pages`.


### Sort Order


The `order` field available on endpoints supporting pagination allows you to
sort the retrieved items by an attribute of that item. For example, you can
sort products by their `created_at` attribute by setting `order` to
`created_at`:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/list/products?order=created_at"
```


By default, the sort direction will be ascending. To change it to
descending, pass a dash (`-`) before the attribute name. For example:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/list/products?order=-created_at"
```


This sorts the products by their `created_at` attribute in the descending
order.
