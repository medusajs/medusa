# PaymentMethodsResource

This class is used to send requests to Payment Method API Routes part of the [Store Customer API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#customers\_postcustomers). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.customers.paymentMethods` property.

All methods in this class require [authentication](../../../modules/customer/page.mdx).

## Methods

### list

Retrieve the logged-in customer's saved payment methods. This method only works with payment providers created with the deprecated Payment Service interface.
The payment methods are saved using the Payment Service's third-party service, and not on the Medusa backend. So, they're retrieved from the third-party service.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged
medusa.customers.paymentMethods.list()
.then(({ payment_methods }) => {
  console.log(payment_methods.length);
})
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"customHeaders","type":"`Record<string, any>`","description":"Custom headers to attach to the request.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"{}","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview#expanding-fields" sectionTitle="list"/>

#### Returns
