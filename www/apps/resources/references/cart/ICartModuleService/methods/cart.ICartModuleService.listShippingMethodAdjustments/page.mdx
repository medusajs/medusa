# listShippingMethodAdjustments - Cart Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listShippingMethodAdjustments` method. This belongs to the Cart Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of shipping method adjustments based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of shipping method adjustments using their IDs:

```ts
const shippingMethodAdjustments =
  await cartModuleService.listShippingMethodAdjustments({
    id: ["casmadj_123", "casmadj_321"],
  })
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the shipping method adjustments:

```ts
const shippingMethodAdjustments =
  await cartModuleService.listShippingMethodAdjustments(
    {
      id: ["casmadj_123", "casmadj_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["shipping_method"],
    }
  )
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const shippingMethodAdjustments =
  await cartModuleService.listShippingMethodAdjustments(
    {
      id: ["casmadj_123", "casmadj_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["shipping_method"],
      take: 20,
      skip: 2,
    }
  )
```
