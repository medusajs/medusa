# listCurrencies - Currency Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listCurrencies` method. This belongs to the Currency Module.

This method is used to retrieve a paginated list of currencies based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of currencies using their codes:

```ts
const currencies = await currencyModuleService.listCurrencies({
  code: ["usd", "eur"],
})
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const currencies = await currencyModuleService.listCurrencies(
  {
    code: ["usd", "eur"],
  },
  {
    take: 20,
    skip: 2,
  }
)
```
