# Configure Medusa Backend

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a file service in the Medusa application and the methods you must implement in it.

The configurations for your Medusa application are in `medusa-config.ts` located in the root of your Medusa project. The configurations include configurations for database, modules, and more.

`medusa-config.ts` exports the value returned by the `defineConfig` utility function imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`.

`defineConfig` accepts as a parameter an object with the following properties:

- [projectConfig](page.mdx#projectconfig) (required): An object that holds general configurations related to the Medusa application, such as database or CORS configurations.
- [admin](page.mdx#admin): An object that holds admin-related configurations.
- [modules](page.mdx#modules): An object that configures the Medusa application's modules.
- [featureFlags](page.mdx#featureflags): An object that enables or disables features guarded by a feature flag.

For example:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
  },
  admin: {
    // ...
  },
  modules: {
    // ...
  },
  featureFlags: {
    // ...
  }
})
```

## Environment Variables

It's highly recommended to store the values of configurations in environment variables, then reference them within `medusa-config.ts`.

During development, you can set your environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of your Medusa application project. In production,
setting the environment variables depends on the hosting provider.

---

## projectConfig

This property holds essential configurations related to the Medusa application, such as database and CORS configurations.

### databaseName

The name of the database to connect to. If the name is specified in `databaseUrl`, then you don't have to use this configuration.

Make sure to create the PostgreSQL database before using it. You can check how to create a database in
[PostgreSQL's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html).

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseName: process.env.DATABASE_NAME ||
      "medusa-store",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseUrl

The PostgreSQL connection URL of the database, which is of the following format:

```bash
postgres://[user][:password]@[host][:port]/[dbname]
```

Where:

- `[user]`: (required) your PostgreSQL username. If not specified, the system's username is used by default. The database user that you use must have create privileges. If you're using the `postgres` superuser, then it should have these privileges by default. Otherwise, make sure to grant your user create privileges. You can learn how to do that in [PostgreSQL's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html).
- `[:password]`: an optional password for the user. When provided, make sure to put `:` before the password.
- `[host]`: (required) your PostgreSQL host. When run locally, it should be `localhost`.
- `[:port]`: an optional port that the PostgreSQL server is listening on. By default, it's `5432`. When provided, make sure to put `:` before the port.
- `[dbname]`: (required) the name of the database.

You can learn more about the connection URL format in [PostgreSQL’s documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html).

#### Example

For example, set the following database URL in your environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost/medusa-store
```

Then, use the value in `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseSchema

The database schema to connect to. This is not required to provide if you’re using the default schema, which is `public`.

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseSchema: process.env.DATABASE_SCHEMA ||
      "custom",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseLogging

This configuration specifies whether database messages should be logged.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseLogging: false
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### databaseDriverOptions

This configuration is used to pass additional options to the database connection. You can pass any configuration. For example, pass the
`ssl` property that enables support for TLS/SSL connections.

This is useful for production databases, which can be supported by setting the `rejectUnauthorized` attribute of `ssl` object to `false`.
During development, it’s recommended not to pass this option.

:::note

Make sure to add to the end of the database URL `?ssl_mode=disable` as well when disabling `rejectUnauthorized`.

:::

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    databaseDriverOptions: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development" ?
      { ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } } : {}
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

#### Properties

<TypeList types={[{"name":"connection","type":"`object`","description":"","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"ssl","type":"`object`","description":"Configure support for TLS/SSL connection","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"rejectUnauthorized","type":"`false`","description":"Whether to fail connection if the server certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs and the hostname and no match is found.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/advanced-development/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="databaseDriverOptions"/>

### redisUrl

This configuration specifies the connection URL to Redis to store the Medusa server's session.

:::note

You must first have Redis installed. You can refer to [Redis's installation guide](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

:::

The Redis connection URL has the following format:

```bash
redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]
```

For a local Redis installation, the connection URL should be `redis://localhost:6379` unless you’ve made any changes to the Redis configuration during installation.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL ||
      "redis://localhost:6379",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### redisPrefix

This configuration defines a prefix on all keys stored in Redis for the Medusa server's session. The default value is `sess:`.

If this configuration option is provided, it is prepended to `sess:`.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    redisPrefix: process.env.REDIS_URL || "medusa:",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### redisOptions

This configuration defines options to pass ioredis for the Redis connection used to store the Medusa server's session. Refer to [ioredis’s RedisOptions documentation](https://redis.github.io/ioredis/index.html#RedisOptions)
for the list of available options.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    redisOptions: {
      connectionName: process.env.REDIS_CONNECTION_NAME ||
        "medusa",
    }
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### sessionOptions

This configuration defines additional options to pass to [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session), which is used to store the Medusa server's session.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    sessionOptions: {
      name: process.env.SESSION_NAME || "custom",
    }
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

#### Properties

<TypeList types={[{"name":"name","type":"`string`","description":"The name of the session ID cookie to set in the response (and read from in the request). The default value is `connect.sid`.\nRefer to [express-session’s documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session#name) for more details.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"resave","type":"`boolean`","description":"Whether the session should be saved back to the session store, even if the session was never modified during the request.

### workerMode

Configure the application's worker mode.

Workers are processes running separately from the main application. They're useful for executing long-running or resource-heavy tasks in the background, such as importing products.

With a worker, these tasks are offloaded to a separate process. So, they won't affect the performance of the main application.

![Diagram showcasing how the server and worker work together](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/fl\_lossy/f\_auto/r\_16/ar\_16:9,c\_pad/v1/Medusa%20Book/medusa-worker\_klkbch.jpg?\_a=BATFJtAA0)

Medusa has three runtime modes:

- Use `shared` to run the application in a single process.
- Use `worker` to run the a worker process only.
- Use `server` to run the application server only.

In production, it's recommended to deploy two instances:

1. One having the `workerMode` configuration set to `server`.
2. Another having the `workerMode` configuration set to `worker`.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    workerMode: process.env.WORKER_MODE || "shared"
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

### http

This property configures the application's http-specific settings.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    http: {
      cookieSecret: "supersecret",
      compression: {
        // ...
      }
    }
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

## admin

This property holds configurations for the Medusa Admin dashboard.

### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    backendUrl: process.env.MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL ||
      "http://localhost:9000"
  },
  // ...
})
```

### disable

Whether to disable the admin dashboard. If set to `true`, the admin dashboard is disabled,
in both development and production environments. The default value is `false`.

#### Example

```ts
title = "medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    disable: process.env.ADMIN_DISABLED === "true" || false,
  },
  // ...
})
```

### path

The path to the admin dashboard. The default value is `/app`.

The value cannot be one of the reserved paths:
- `/admin`
- `/store`
- `/auth`
- `/`

:::note

When using Docker, make sure that the root path of the Docker image doesn't path the admin's `path`. For example, if the Docker image's root path is `/app`, change
the value of the `path` configuration, as it's `/app` by default.

:::

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    path: process.env.ADMIN_PATH || `/app`,
  },
  // ...
})
```

### outDir

The directory where the admin build is outputted when you run the `build` command.
The default value is `./build`.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    outDir: process.env.ADMIN_BUILD_DIR || `./build`,
  },
  // ...
})
```

### backendUrl

The URL of your Medusa application. This is useful to set when you deploy the Medusa application.

#### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    backendUrl: process.env.MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL ||
      "http://localhost:9000"
  },
  // ...
})
```

### vite

Configure the Vite configuration for the admin dashboard. This function receives the default Vite configuration
and returns the modified configuration. The default value is `undefined`.

___

## modules

This property holds all custom modules installed in your Medusa application.

:::note

Medusa's commerce modules are configured by default, so only
add them to this property if you're changing their configurations or adding providers to a module.

:::

`modules` is an array of objects, each holding a module's registration configurations. Each object has the following properties:

1. `resolve`: a string indicating the path to the module relative to `src`, or the module's NPM package name. For example, `./modules/my-module`.
2. `options`: (optional) an object indicating the options to pass to the module.

### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "./modules/hello"
    }
  ]
  // ...
})
```

___

## featureFlags

Some features in the Medusa application are guarded by a feature flag. This ensures constant shipping of new features while maintaining the engine’s stability.

You can enable a feature in your application by enabling its feature flag. Feature flags are enabled through either environment
variables or through this configuration property exported in `medusa-config.ts`.

The `featureFlags`'s value is an object. Its properties are the names of the feature flags, and their value is a boolean indicating whether the feature flag is enabled.

You can find available feature flags and their key name [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/packages/medusa/src/loaders/feature-flags).

### Example

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  featureFlags: {
    analytics: true,
    // ...
  }
  // ...
})
```

:::note

After enabling a feature flag, make sure to run migrations as it may require making changes to the database.

:::
