# Configure Medusa Backend

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a file service in the Medusa backend and the methods you must implement in it.

The configurations for your Medusa backend are in `medusa-config.js` located in the root of your Medusa project. The configurations include database, modules, and plugin configurations, among other configurations.

`medusa-config.js` exports an object having the following properties:

- [projectConfig](page.mdx#projectconfig) (required): An object that holds general configurations related to the Medusa backend, such as database or CORS configurations.
- [admin](page.mdx#admin): An object that holds admin-related configurations.
- [plugins](page.mdx#plugins): An array of plugin configurations that defines what plugins are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [modules](page.mdx#modules): An object that defines what modules are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [featureFlags](page.mdx#featureflags): An object that enables or disables features guarded by a feature flag.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig,
  admin,
  modules,
  featureFlags,
}
```

---

## Environment Variables

It's highly recommended to store the values of configurations in environment variables, then reference them within `medusa-config.js`.

During development, you can set your environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of your Medusa backend project. In production,
setting the environment variables depends on the hosting provider.

---

## projectConfig

This property holds essential configurations related to the Medusa backend, such as database and CORS configurations.

### database\_database

The name of the database to connect to. If specified in `databaseUrl`, then it’s not required to include it.

Make sure to create the PostgreSQL database before using it. You can check how to create a database in
[PostgreSQL's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html).

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    databaseName: process.env.DATABASE_DATABASE || "medusa-store",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### databaseUrl

The connection URL of the database. The format of the connection URL for PostgreSQL is:

```bash
postgres://[user][:password]@[host][:port]/[dbname]
```

Where:

- `[user]`: (required) your PostgreSQL username. If not specified, the system's username is used by default. The database user that you use must have create privileges. If you're using the `postgres` superuser, then it should have these privileges by default. Otherwise, make sure to grant your user create privileges. You can learn how to do that in [PostgreSQL's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html).
- `[:password]`: an optional password for the user. When provided, make sure to put `:` before the password.
- `[host]`: (required) your PostgreSQL host. When run locally, it should be `localhost`.
- `[:port]`: an optional port that the PostgreSQL server is listening on. By default, it's `5432`. When provided, make sure to put `:` before the port.
- `[dbname]`: (required) the name of the database.

You can learn more about the connection URL format in [PostgreSQL’s documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html).

#### Example

For example, set the following database URL in your environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost/medusa-store
```

Then, use the value in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### databaseSchema

The database schema to connect to. This is not required to provide if you’re using the default schema, which is `public`.

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    databaseSchema: process.env.DATABASE_SCHEMA || "custom",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### databaseLogging

This configuration specifies what database messages to log. Its value can be one of the following:

- (default) A boolean value that indicates whether any messages should be logged.
- The string value `all` that indicates all types of messages should be logged.
- An array of log-level strings to indicate which type of messages to show in the logs. The strings can be `query`, `schema`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `log`, or `migration`. Refer to [Typeorm’s documentation](https://typeorm.io/logging#logging-options) for more details on what each of these values means.

If this configuration isn't set, its default value is `false`, meaning no database messages are logged.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    databaseLogging: ["query", "error"],
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### databaseExtra

An object that includes additional configurations to pass to the database connection. You can pass any configuration. One defined configuration to pass is
`ssl` which enables support for TLS/SSL connections.

This is useful for production databases, which can be supported by setting the `rejectUnauthorized` attribute of `ssl` object to `false`.
During development, it’s recommended not to pass this option.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    databaseExtra:
      process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development"
        ? { ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } }
        : {},
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### databaseDriverOptions

An object that includes additional configurations to pass to the database connection for v2. You can pass any configuration. One defined configuration to pass is
`ssl` which enables support for TLS/SSL connections.

This is useful for production databases, which can be supported by setting the `rejectUnauthorized` attribute of `ssl` object to `false`.
During development, it’s recommended not to pass this option.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    databaseDriverOptions:
      process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development"

        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
  sectionTitle="database_driver_options"
/>

### redisUrl

Used to specify the URL to connect to Redis. This is only used for scheduled jobs. If you omit this configuration, scheduled jobs won't work.

:::note

You must first have Redis installed. You can refer to [Redis's installation guide](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

:::

The Redis connection URL has the following format:

```bash
redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]
```

For a local Redis installation, the connection URL should be `redis://localhost:6379` unless you’ve made any changes to the Redis configuration during installation.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL || "redis://localhost:6379",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### redisPrefix

The prefix set on all keys stored in Redis. The default value is `sess:`.

If this configuration option is provided, it is prepended to `sess:`.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    redisPrefix: process.env.REDIS_PREFIX || "medusa:",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### redisOptions

An object of options to pass ioredis. You can refer to [ioredis’s RedisOptions documentation](https://redis.github.io/ioredis/index.html#RedisOptions)
for the list of available options.

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    redisOptions: {
      connectionName: process.env.REDIS_CONNECTION_NAME || "medusa",
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### sessionOptions

### http_compression

Configure HTTP compression from the application layer. If you have access to the HTTP server, the recommended approach would be to enable it there.
However, some platforms don't offer access to the HTTP layer and in those cases, this is a good alternative.

If you enable HTTP compression and you want to disable it for specific API Routes, you can pass in the request header `"x-no-compression": true`.

:::note[Deprecated]

use [http](../medusa_config.ProjectConfigOptions/page.mdx#http)'s `compression` property instead.

:::

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    http_compression: {
      enabled: true,
      level: 6,
      memLevel: 8,
      threshold: 1024,
    },
    // ...

    jobs_batch_size: 100,
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### worker_mode

Configure the application's worker mode. Default is `shared`.

- Use `shared` to run the application in a single process.
- Use `worker` to run the a worker process only.
- Use `server` to run the application server only.

Learn more in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/medusa-worker).

#### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    worker_mode: "shared",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### http

Configure the application's http-specific settings

#### Example

___

## admin

Admin dashboard configurations.

### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  admin: {
    backendUrl: process.env.MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL || "http://localhost:9000"
  }
  // ...
}
```

### disable

Whether to disable the admin dashboard. If set to `true`, the admin dashboard is disabled,
in both development and production environments. The default value is `false`.

### path

The path to the admin dashboard. The default value is `/app`.

The value cannot be one of the reserved paths:
- `/admin`
- `/store`
- `/auth`
- `/`

### outDir

The directory where the admin build is output. This is where the build process places the generated files.
The default value is `./build`.

### backendUrl

The URL of your Medusa backend. Defaults to an empty string, which means requests will hit the same server that serves the dashboard.

### vite

Configure the Vite configuration for the admin dashboard. This function receives the default Vite configuration
and returns the modified configuration. The default value is `undefined`.

___

## plugins

On your Medusa backend, you can use [Plugins](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/plugins/overview) to add custom features or integrate third-party services.
For example, installing a plugin to use Stripe as a payment processor.

Aside from installing the plugin with NPM, you need to pass the plugin you installed into the `plugins` array defined in `medusa-config.js`.

The items in the array can either be:

- A string, which is the name of the plugin to add. You can pass a plugin as a string if it doesn’t require any configurations.
- An object having the following properties:
  - `resolve`: The name of the plugin.
  - `options`: An object that includes the plugin’s options. These options vary for each plugin, and you should refer to the plugin’s documentation for available options.

### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `medusa-my-plugin-1`,
    {
      resolve: `medusa-my-plugin`,
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.MY_API_KEY || `test`,
      },
    },
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
```

---

## modules

In Medusa, commerce and core logic are modularized to allow developers to extend or replace certain [modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/modules/overview)
with custom implementations.

Aside from installing the module with NPM, you must add it to the exported object in `medusa-config.js`.

The keys of the `modules` configuration object refer to the type of module. Its value can be one of the following:

1. A boolean value indicating whether the module type is enabled;
2. Or a string value indicating the name of the module to be used for the module type. This can be used if the module does not require any options;
3. Or an object having the following properties, but typically you would mainly use the `resolve` and `options` properties only:
   1. `resolve`: a string indicating the name of the module.
   2. `options`: an object indicating the options to pass to the module. These options vary for each module, and you should refer to the module’s documentation for details on them.
   3. `resources`: a string indicating whether the module shares the dependency container with the Medusa core. Its value can either be `shared` or `isolated`. Refer to the [Modules documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/modules/create#module-scope) for more details.
   4. `alias`: a string indicating a unique alias to register the module under. Other modules can’t use the same alias.
   5. `main`: a boolean value indicating whether this module is the main registered module. This is useful when an alias is used.

### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  modules: {
    eventBus: {
      resolve: "@medusajs/event-bus-local",
    },
    cacheService: {
      resolve: "@medusajs/cache-redis",
      options: {
        redisUrl: process.env.CACHE_REDIS_URL,
        ttl: 30,
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

---

## featureFlags

Some features in the Medusa backend are guarded by a feature flag. This ensures constant shipping of new features while maintaining the engine’s stability.

You can specify whether a feature should or shouldn’t be used in your backend by enabling its feature flag. Feature flags can be enabled through either environment
variables or through this configuration exported in `medusa-config.js`.

If you want to use the environment variables method, learn more about it in the [Feature Flags documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/feature-flags/toggle#method-one-using-environment-variables).

The `featureFlags` configuration is an object. Its properties are the names of the feature flags. Each property’s value is a boolean indicating whether the feature flag is enabled.

You can find available feature flags and their key name [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages/medusa/src/loaders/feature-flags).

### Example

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  featureFlags: {
    product_categories: true,
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

:::note

After enabling a feature flag, make sure to [run migrations](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/migrations/overview#migrate-command) as it may require making changes to the database.
