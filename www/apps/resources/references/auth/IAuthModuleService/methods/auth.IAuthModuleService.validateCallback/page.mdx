# validateCallback - Auth Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `validateCallback` method. This belongs to the Auth Module.

When authenticating users with a third-party provider, such as Google, the user performs an
action to finish the authentication, such as enter their credentials in Google's sign-in
form.

In those cases, you must create an API route or endpoint that's called by the third-party
provider when the user finishes performing the required action.

In that API route, you can call this method to validate the third-party provider's
callback and authenticate the user.

Learn more about this authentication flow in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/auth/auth-flows#authentication-with-third-party-service).

## Example

The following example is in the context of an API route, where
`req` is an instance of the `MedusaRequest` object:

```ts
const { success, authIdentity, error, successRedirectUrl } =
  await authModuleService.validateCallback("google", {
    url: req.url,
    headers: req.headers,
    query: req.query,
    body: req.body,
    protocol: req.protocol,
  } as AuthenticationInput)
```

## Parameters

This takes precedence before\nthe `success` field.\n\nSo, after checking that authentication is successful,\nyou should check whether this field is defined and, if so, redirect to the\nspecified location.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"successRedirectUrl","type":"`string`","description":"Some authentication providers support redirecting to a specified URL on\nsuccess.
