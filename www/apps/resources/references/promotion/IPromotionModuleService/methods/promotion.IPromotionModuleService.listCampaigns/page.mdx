# listCampaigns - Promotion Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listCampaigns` method. This belongs to the Promotion Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of campaigns based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of campaigns using their IDs:

```ts
const campaigns = await promotionModuleService.listCampaigns({
  id: ["procamp_123"],
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the campaigns:

```ts
const campaigns = await promotionModuleService.listCampaigns(
  {
    id: ["procamp_123"],
  },
  {
    relations: ["promotions"],
  }
)
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const campaigns = await promotionModuleService.listCampaigns(
  {
    id: ["procamp_123"],
  },
  {
    relations: ["promotions"],
    take: 20,
    skip: 2,
  }
)
```
