# softDeleteProductCollections - Product Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `softDeleteProductCollections` method. This belongs to the Product Module.

This method is used to delete product collections. Unlike the deleteCollections method, this method won't completely remove the collection. It can still be accessed or retrieved using methods like retrieveCollections if you pass the `withDeleted` property to the `config` object parameter.

The soft-deleted collections can be restored using the restoreCollections method.

## Example

```ts
await productModuleService.softDeleteProductCollections([
  "pcol_123",
  "pcol_321",
])
```
