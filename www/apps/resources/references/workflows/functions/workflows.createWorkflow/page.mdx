# createWorkflow - Workflows API Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `createWorkflow` . It belongs to the `@medusajs/workflows-sdk` package.

This function creates a workflow with the provided name and a constructor function.
The constructor function builds the workflow from steps created by the [createStep](../workflows.createStep/page.mdx) function.
The returned workflow is an exported workflow of type [ReturnWorkflow](../../types/workflows.ReturnWorkflow/page.mdx), meaning it's not executed right away. To execute it,
invoke the exported workflow, then run its `run` method.

## Example

```ts
import { createWorkflow } from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse, Product } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import {
  createProductStep,
  getProductStep,
  createPricesStep
} from "./steps"

interface WorkflowInput {
 title: string
}

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow<
    WorkflowInput,
    Product
  >("my-workflow", (input) => {
   // Everything here will be executed and resolved later
   // during the execution. Including the data access.

    const product = createProductStep(input)
    const prices = createPricesStep(product)
    return getProductStep(product.id)
  }
)

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { result: product } = await myWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run({
      input: {
        title: "Shirt"
      }
    })

  res.json({
    product
  })
}
```
