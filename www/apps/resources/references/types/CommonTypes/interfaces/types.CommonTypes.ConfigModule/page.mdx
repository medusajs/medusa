# ConfigModule

The configurations for your Medusa backend are in `medusa-config.js` located in the root of your Medusa project. The configurations include database, modules, and plugin configurations, among other configurations.

`medusa-config.js` exports an object having the following properties:

- [projectConfig](page.mdx#projectconfig) (required): An object that holds general configurations related to the Medusa backend, such as database or CORS configurations.
- [admin](page.mdx#admin): An object that holds admin-related configurations.
- ConfigModule.plugins | plugins: An array of plugin configurations that defines what plugins are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [modules](page.mdx#modules): An object that defines what modules are installed and optionally specifies each of their configurations.
- [featureFlags](page.mdx#featureflags): An object that enables or disables features guarded by a feature flag.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
  },
  admin: {
    // ...
  },
  modules: {
    // ...
  },
  featureFlags: {
    // ...
  }
})
```

## Environment Variables

It's highly recommended to store the values of configurations in environment variables, then reference them within `medusa-config.js`.

During development, you can set your environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of your Medusa backend project. In production,
setting the environment variables depends on the hosting provider.
