# fetch

`fetch` closely follows (and uses under the hood) the native `fetch` API. There are, however, few key differences:
- Non 2xx statuses throw a `FetchError` with the status code as the `status` property, rather than resolving the promise
- You can pass `body` and `query` as objects, and they will be encoded and stringified.
- The response gets parsed as JSON if the `accept` header is set to `application/json`, otherwise the raw Response object is returned

Since the response is dynamically determined, we cannot know if it is JSON or not. Therefore, it is important to pass `Response` as the return type
