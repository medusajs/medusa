# listFulfillmentSets - Fulfillment Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listFulfillmentSets` method. This belongs to the Fulfillment Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of fulfillment sets based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of fulfillment sets using their IDs:

```ts
const fulfillmentSets = await fulfillmentModuleService.listFulfillmentSets({
  id: ["fuset_123", "fuset_321"],
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the fulfillment set:

```ts
const fulfillmentSets = await fulfillmentModuleService.listFulfillmentSets(
  {
    id: ["fuset_123", "fuset_321"],
  },
  {
    relations: ["search_zones"],
  }
)
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const fulfillmentSets = await fulfillmentModuleService.listFulfillmentSets(
  {
    id: ["fuset_123", "fuset_321"],
  },
  {
    relations: ["search_zones"],
    take: 20,
    skip: 2,
  }
)
```
