# {metadata.title}

This guide provides some troubleshooting step as to why your admin widget / UI route isn't showing in the Medusa Admin dashboard.

## Incorrect Zone

If you're adding an admin widget, make sure you're using a correct zone.

Refer to the [Admin Widget Injection Zones list](../../../admin-widget-injection-zones/page.mdx) for reference.

---

## Incorrect Function Definition

Widget and UI routes must be defined as arrow functions. Any other type of declaration isn't accepted.

Refer to the [Admin Development Constraints](!docs!/learn/advanced-development/admin/constraints) documentation for more details.

---

## Incorrect Type of Zone Value

A widget zone's value must be wrapped in double or single quotes:

```ts
export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})
```

Any other usage leads to the widget not being shown.

Refer to the [Admin Development Constraints](!docs!/learn/advanced-development/admin/constraints) documentation for more details.

## Errors in Docker

If you're using a Docker image to host your Medusa application, make sure that the image's root path is different than the Medusa Admin's `path` configuration.

For example, if your Docker image's root path is `/app`, make sure to change the `path` configuration in `medusa-config.ts`, as it's `/app` by default:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    path: `/dashboard`,
  },
  // ...
})
```
