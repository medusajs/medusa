If you've installed a preview version of a package, such as `@medusajs/medusa/file-s3`, make sure its version in `package.json` is set to `preview`:

```json title="package.json"
"dependencies": {
  // ...
  "@medusajs/medusa/file-s3": "preview"
}
```

Otherwise, unexpected errors may occur when running the Medusa application due to outdated version installed.
