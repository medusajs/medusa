This method retrieves a list of records.

## Retrieve List of Records

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts()
```

If no parameters are passed, the method returns an array of the first `15` records.

---

## Filter Records

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  id: ["123", "321"],
})
```

### Parameters

To retrieve records matching a set of filters, pass an object of the filters as a first parameter.

<Note>

Learn more about accepted filters in [this documentation](../../tips/filtering/page.mdx).

</Note>

### Returns

The method returns an array of the first `15` records matching the filters.

## Retrieve Relations

<Note>

This applies to relations between data models of the same module. To retrieve linked records of different modules, use [remote query](!docs!/advanced-development/modules/remote-query).

</Note>

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({}, {
  relations: ["author"],
})
```

### Parameters

To retrieve records with their relations, pass as a second parameter an object having a `relations` property. `relations`'s value is an array of relation names.

### Returns

The method returns an array of the first `15` records matching the filters.

---

## Select Properties

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({}, {
  select: ["id", "name"],
})
```

### Parameters

By default, retrieved records have all their properties. To select specific properties to retrieve, pass in the second object parameter a `select` property.

`select`'s value is an array of property names to retrieve.

### Returns

The method returns an array of the first `15` records matching the filters.

---

## Paginate Relations

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({}, {
  take: 20,
  skip: 10,
})
```

### Parameters

To paginate the returned records, the second object parameter accepts the following properties:

- `take`: a number indicating how many records to retrieve. By default, it's `15`.
- `skip`: a number indicating how many records to skip before the retrieved records. By default, it's `0`.

### Returns

The method returns an array of records. The number of records is less than or equal to `take`'s value.

---

## Sort Records

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({}, {
  order: {
    name: "ASC",
  },
})
```

### Parameters

To sort records by one or more properties, pass to the second object parameter the `order` property. Its value is an object whose keys are the property names, and values can either be:

- `ASC` to sort by this property in the ascending order.
- `DESC` to sort by this property in the descending order.

### Returns

The method returns an array of the first `15` records matching the filters.
