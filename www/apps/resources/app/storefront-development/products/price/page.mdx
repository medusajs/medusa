# {metadata.title}

In this document, you'll learn how to show a product's variants' prices in the storefront, including handling sale prices.

## Pricing Query Parameters

When you retrieve products either with the [List Products](!api!/store#products_getproducts) or [Retrieve Products](!api!/store#products_getproductsid) API routes, you must pass include in the beginning of the `fields` query parameter the value `*variants.calculated_price`.

You also must pass at least one of the following query parameters to retrieve the correct product variant price:

- `region_id`: The ID of the customer's region. This parameter must be included if you want to apply taxes on the product's price.
- `currency_code`: The currency code the customer is viewing prices in. This parameter must be included if you want to apply taxes on the product's price.
- `customer_id`: The ID of the customer viewing the prices. This is useful when you have a promotion or price list overriding a product's price for specific customer groups.
- `customer_group_id`: The ID of the group of the customer viewing the prices. This is useful when you have a promotion or price list overriding a product's price for specific customer groups.

## Product Variant's Price Properties

If you pass the parameters mentioned above, each variant has a `calculated_price` object with the following properties:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>Property</Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>Description</Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>Notes</Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        `calculated_amount`
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The product variant's price.
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Show this price if you didn't supply the `region_id` and `country_code` query parameters to retrieve prices with taxes applied.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        `calculated_amount_with_tax`
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The `calculated_amount` with taxes applied.
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        This property is only available if you supply both the `region_id` and `country_code` query parameters.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        `calculated_amount_without_tax`
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
         The `calculated_amount` without taxes applied.
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        This property is only available if you supply both the `region_id` and `country_code` query parameters.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        `price_list_type`
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
         The type of the variant price.
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        If its value is `sale`, it means the `calculated_amount` is a sale price. You can show the amount before the sale using the `original_amount` property.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>
