# {metadata.title}

In this document, you'll learn how to use Stripe for payment during checkout in a React-based storefront.

<Note title="Tip">

For other types of storefronts, the steps are similar. However, refer to [Stripe's documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/) for available tools for your tech stack.

</Note>

<Note type="check">

- [Stripe Module Provider](../../../../commerce-modules/payment/payment-provider/stripe/page.mdx) installed and configured in your Medusa application.
- [Stripe publishable API key](https://support.stripe.com/questions/locate-api-keys-in-the-dashboard).

</Note>

## 1. Install Stripe SDK

In your storefront, use the following command to install Stripe's JS and React SDKs:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

---

## 2. Add Stripe Environment Variables

Next, add an environment variable holding your Stripe publishable API key.

For example:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PK=pk_test_51Kj...
```

<Note title="Tip">

For Next.js storefronts, the environment variable's name must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`. If your storefront's framework requires a different prefix, make sure to change it.

</Note>

## 3. Create Stripe Component

Then, create a file holding the following Stripe component:

export const highlights = [
  ["10", "useCart", "The `useCart` hook was defined in the Cart React Context documentation."],
  ["13", "stripePromise", "Initialize stripe using the environment variable added in the previous step."],
  ["19", "clientSecret", "After initializing the payment session of Stripe in the Medusa application,\nthe client secret is available in the payment session's `data`."],
  ["27", "StripeForm", "The actual form must be a different component nested inside `Elements`."],
  ["44", "handlePayment", "This function is used to show Stripe's UI to accept payment,\nthen send the request to the Medusa application to complete the cart."],
  ["61", "confirmCardPayment", "This function shows the UI to the customer to accept the card payment."],
  ["78", "", "Once the customer enters their card details and submits the form,\nthe Promise resolves and executes this function."],
  ["85", "fetch", "Send a request to the Medusa application\nto complete the cart and place the order."],
  ["94", `type === "cart"`, "If the `type` returned is `cart`,\nit means an error occurred and the cart wasn't completed."],
  ["97", `type === "order"`, "If the `type` returned is `order`,\nit means the cart was completed and the order was placed successfully."],
  ["101", "refreshCart", "Unset and reset the cart."],
  ["111", "button", "This button triggers the `handlePayment` function when clicked."]
]

```tsx highlights={highlights}
"use client" // include with Next.js 13+

import { 
  CardElement, 
  Elements, 
  useElements, 
  useStripe,
} from "@stripe/react-stripe-js"
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js"
import { useCart } from "../../providers/cart"
import { useState } from "react"

const stripePromise = loadStripe(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PK || "temp"
)

export default function StripePayment() {
  const { cart } = useCart()
  const clientSecret = cart?.payment_collection?.
    payment_sessions?.[0].data.client_secret as string

  return (
    <div>
      <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={{
          clientSecret,
        }}>
        <StripeForm clientSecret={clientSecret} />
      </Elements>
    </div>
  )
}

const StripeForm = ({ 
  clientSecret,
}: {
  clientSecret: string | undefined
}) => {
  const { cart, refreshCart } = useCart()
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  const stripe = useStripe()
  const elements = useElements()

  async function handlePayment(
    e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>
  ) {
    e.preventDefault()
    const card = elements?.getElement(CardElement)

    if (
      !stripe || 
      !elements ||
      !card ||
      !cart ||
      !clientSecret
    ) {
      return
    }

    setLoading(true)
    stripe?.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret, {
      payment_method: {
        card,
        billing_details: {
          name: cart.billing_address?.first_name,
          email: cart.email,
          phone: cart.billing_address?.phone,
          address: {
            city: cart.billing_address?.city,
            country: cart.billing_address?.country_code,
            line1: cart.billing_address?.address_1,
            line2: cart.billing_address?.address_2,
            postal_code: cart.billing_address?.postal_code,
          },
        },
      },
    })
    .then(({ error }) => {
      if (error) {
        // TODO handle errors
        console.error(error)
        return
      }

      fetch(
        `http://localhost:9000/store/carts/${cart.id}/complete`,
        {
          credentials: "include",
          method: "POST",
        }
      )
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(({ type, cart, order, error }) => {
        if (type === "cart" && cart) {
          // an error occured
          console.error(error)
        } else if (type === "order" && order) {
          // TODO redirect to order success page
          alert("Order placed.")
          console.log(order)
          refreshCart()
        }
      })
    })
    .finally(() => setLoading(false))
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <CardElement />
      <button 
        onClick={handlePayment}
        disabled={loading}
      >
        Place Order
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

In the code snippet above, you:

1. Create a `StripePayment` component that wraps the actual form with Stripe's `Elements` component.
    - In the `StripePayment` component, you obtain the client secret from the payment session's `data` field. This is set in the Medusa application.
2. Create a `StripeForm` component that holds the actual form. In this component, you implement a `handlePayment` function that does the following:
    - Use Stripe's `confirmCardPayment` method to accept the card details from the customer.
    - Once the customer enters their card details and submit their order, the resolution function of the `confirmCardPayment` method is executed.
    - In the resolution function, you send a request to the [Complete Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcartsidcomplete) to complete the cart and place the order.
    - In the received response of the request, if the `type` is `cart`, it means that the cart completion failed. The error is set in the `error` response field.
    - If the `type` is `order`, it means the card was completed and the order was placed successfully. You can access the order in the `order` response field.
    - When the order is placed, you refresh the cart. You can redirect the customer to an order success page at this point.

## 4. Use the Stripe Component

You can now use the Stripe component in the checkout flow. You should render it after the customer chooses Stripe as a payment provider.

For example, you can use it in the `getPaymentUi` function defined in the [Payment Checkout Step guide](../page.mdx):

```tsx highlights={[["10"]]}
const getPaymentUi = useCallback(() => {
  const activePaymentSession = cart?.payment_collection?.
    payment_sessions?.[0]
  if (!activePaymentSession) {
    return
  }

  switch(true) {
    case activePaymentSession.provider_id.startsWith("pp_stripe_"):
      return <StripePayment />
    // ...
  }
} , [cart])
```
