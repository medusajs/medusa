This recipe provides the general steps to follow to create an ecommerce store with Medusa.

## Overview

Businesses use ecommerce stores to:

- Provide an online catalog for customers.
- Accept customer orders and payment.
- Manage their store's data and logistics.

Medusa provides all essential commerce features out-of-the-box. Businesses can go live and start selling without making any adjustments. They can also power-up their store by integrating third-party services for payments, fulfillment, and more.

## Install Ecommerce Store Powered by Medusa

Use the following command to install an ecommerce store with Medusa:

```bash
npx create-medusa-app@preview --with-nextjs-starter
```

This installs:

- The Medusa application, which is composed of a Node.js server and a Medusa Admin dashboard. The dashboard opens right after the installation finishes, where you can create a user and start managing your store's data.
- A [Next.js starter storefront](../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx) that connects to your Medusa application to provide customers with ecommerce features.

## Integrate Third-Party Services

You can integrate third-party services and tools, customizing the architecture and commerce features of your store.

For example, you can integrate Stripe for payment, or SendGrid for notifications.
