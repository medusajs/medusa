A Cache Module is used to cache the results of computations such as price selection or various tax calculations.

The underlying database, third-party service, or caching logic is flexible since it's implemented in a module. You can choose from Medusa’s cache modules or create your own to support something more suitable for your architecture.

## List of Cache Modules

By default, Medusa uses the In-Memory Cache Module. This module uses a plain JavaScript Map object to store the cache data.

This is useful for development. However, for production, it's highly recommended to use other Cache Modules, such as the Redis Cache Module.
