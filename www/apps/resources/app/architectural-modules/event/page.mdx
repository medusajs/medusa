An Event Module implements the underlying publish/subscribe system that handles queueing events, emitting them, and executing their subscribers. 

This makes the event architecture customizable, as you can either choose one of Medusa’s event modules or create your own.

## List of Event Modules

By default, Medusa uses the Local Event Module. This module uses Node’s EventEmitter to implement the publish/subscribe system.

This is useful for development. However, for production, it’s highly recommended to use other Event Modules, Redis Event Module.
