# {metadata.title}

[Medusa React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medusa-react) is a React library that provides a set of utilities and hooks for interacting seamlessly with the Medusa backend.

For example, if you're creating a storefront with frameworks like Nuxt, you can send requests to the backend using this client. You can also use it in your Medusa Admin customizations.

This reference provides details on the available hooks, providers, and utilities, including examples of each.

## Installation

In the directory holding your React-based storefront or admin dashboard, run the following command to install Medusa React:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install medusa-react @tanstack/react-query@4.22 @medusajs/medusa
```

In addition to the `medusa-react` library, you need the following libraries:

1. `@tanstack/react-query`: `medusa-react` is built on top of [Tanstack Query v4.22](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview). You’ll learn later in this reference how you can use Mutations and Queries with Medusa React.
2. `@medusajs/medusa`: The core Medusa package. This is used to import types used by Medusa React and while developing with it.

<Note>

Part of the Medusa roadmap is to move the types into a separate package, removing the need to install the core Medusa package in your storefront or admin dashboard. You can check other items on our roadmap in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions/categories/roadmap).

</Note>

## Usage

To use the hooks exposed by Medusa React, include the `MedusaProvider` somewhere up in your component tree.

The `MedusaProvider` requires two props:

1. `baseUrl`: The URL to your Medusa backend
2. `queryClientProviderProps`: An object used to set the Tanstack Query client. The object requires a `client` property, which should be an instance of [QueryClient](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/QueryClient).

Learn about other optional props in [this reference](/references/medusa-react/providers/medusa)

For example:

```tsx title="src/App.ts"
import { MedusaProvider } from "medusa-react"
import Storefront from "./Storefront"
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import React from "react"

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MedusaProvider
      queryClientProviderProps={{ client: queryClient }}
      baseUrl="http://localhost:9000"
    >
      <Storefront />
    </MedusaProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

In the example above, you wrap the `Storefront` component with the `MedusaProvider`. `Storefront` is assumed to be the top-level component of your storefront, but you can place `MedusaProvider` at any point in your tree.

Only children of `MedusaProvider` can benefit from its hooks. So, the `Storefront` component and its child components can now use hooks exposed by Medusa React.

<Details summaryContent="Troubleshooting: Could not find a declaration file for module 'medusa-react'">

  If you import `medusa-react` in your code and see the following TypeScript error:

  ```bash
  Could not find a declaration file for module 'medusa-react'
  ```

  Make sure to set `moduleResolution` in your `tsconfig.json` to `nodenext` or `node`:

  ```json title="tsconfig.json"
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "moduleResolution": "nodenext",
      // ...
    },
    // ...
  }
  ```
</Details>

## How to Use this Reference

You'll find in the sidebar three main categories to explore:

- Hooks: Includes all hooks used to send requests to the backend. Hooks are also split into Admin hooks that send requests to the admin, and Store hooks, that send requests to the store.
- Providers: Includes React providers helpful for your development using Medusa React.
- Utilities: Utility functions that are mainly useful for displaying product and variant pricing.

## Queries and Mutations

Since Medusa React is built on top of Tanstack Queries, hooks can either be queries or mutations.

### Queries

To fetch data from the Medusa backend (in other words, perform `GET` requests), you can use [Queries](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/queries). 

Query hooks simply wrap around Tanstack Query's `useQuery` hook to fetch data from your Medusa backend.

For example, to fetch products from your Medusa backend:

```tsx title="src/Products.ts"
import { Product } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { useProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useProducts()

  return isLoading ? (
    <div>
      Loading...
    </div>
  ) : (
    <ul>
      {products?.map((product: Product) => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          {product.title}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default Products
```

In the example above, you import the `useProducts` hook from `medusa-react`. 

This hook, and every other query hook exposed by `medusa-react`, returns everything that `useQuery` [returns in Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery), except for the `data` field. Instead of the `data` field, the response data is flattened and is part of the hooks’ returned fields (see `products` in the example above).

You can learn more about using queries in [Tanstack Query’s documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/queries).

### Mutations

To create, update, or delete data on the Medusa backend (in other words, perform `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests), you can use [Mutations](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/mutations).

Mutation hooks wrap around Tanstack Query's `useMutation` to mutate data on your Medusa backend.

For example, to create a cart:

```tsx title="src/Cart.ts"
import { useCreateCart } from "medusa-react"

const Cart = () => {
  const createCart = useCreateCart()
  const handleClick = () => {
    createCart.mutate({}) // create an empty cart
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {createCart.isLoading && <div>Loading...</div>}
      {!createCart.data?.cart && (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
          Create cart
        </button>
      )}
      {createCart.data?.cart?.id && (
        <div>Cart ID: {createCart.data?.cart.id}</div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Cart
```

In the example above, you import the `useCreateCart` hook from `medusa-react`. This hook, and every other mutation hook exposed by `medusa-react`, returns everything that [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useMutation) returns. You can also pass the same options you would pass to `useMutation` to mutation hooks exposed by `medusa-react`.

To create a cart, you call the `createCart.mutate` method. In the underlying logic, this method sends a `POST` request to the Medusa backend to create a cart.

If the request accepts any parameters, they can be passed as parameters to the `mutate` request. For example:

```ts
createCart.mutate({
  region_id,
})
```

Instead of using `mutate`, you can use `mutateAsync` to receive a Promise that resolves on success or throws on error.

Learn more about how you can use mutations in [Tanstack Query’s documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/mutations).

## Authentication

### Admin Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate an admin user:

1. Using the [useAdminLogin hook](/references/medusa-react/hooks/admin/auth#useadminlogin). This hook tries to authenticate the user by their email and password credential and, if successful, attaches the cookie session ID to subsequent requests.
2. Using the `apiKey` option of the [MedusaProvider](/references/medusa-react/providers/medusa#medusaprovider) if the admin has an API key. If the admin doesn't have an API key, you can create one using the [useAdminUpdateUser hook](/references/medusa-react/hooks/admin/users#useAdminUpdateUser) or the [Update User API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#users_postusersuser).

For example:

<LegacyCodeTabs tabs={[
  {
    value: "useadminlogin",
    label: "useAdminLogin hook",
    code: {
      lang: "ts",
      source: `import React from "react"
    import { useAdminLogin } from "medusa-react"

    const Login = () => {
      const adminLogin = useAdminLogin()
      // ...

      const handleLogin = () => {
        adminLogin.mutate({
          email: "user@example.com",
          password: "supersecret",
        }, {
          onSuccess: ({ user }) => {
            console.log(user)
            // send authenticated requests now
          }
        })
      }

      // ...
    }

    export default Login`
    }
  },
  {
    value: "apikey",
    label: "apikey Option", 
    code: {
      lang: "tsx",
      source: `import { MedusaProvider } from "medusa-react"
    import Storefront from "./Storefront"
    import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
    import React from "react"

    const queryClient = new QueryClient()

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <MedusaProvider
          queryClientProviderProps={{ client: queryClient }}
          baseUrl="http://localhost:9000"
          apiKey={process.env.API_KEY}
        >
          <Storefront />
        </MedusaProvider>
      )
    }

    export default App`
    }
  }
]} group="admin-auth" />

### Customer Authentication

To authenticate a customer, use the [useMedusa hook](/references/medusa-react/providers/medusa#usemedusa) to access the underlying [Medusa JS Client](../js-client/page.mdx) instance and use one of its [authentication methods](../js-client/page.mdx#authentication), such as the [authenticate](/references/js-client/AuthResource#authenticate) method.

For example:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useMeCustomer, useMedusa } from "medusa-react"

const CustomerLogin = () => {
  const { client } = useMedusa()
  const { refetch: refetchCustomer } = useMeCustomer()
  // ...

  const handleLogin = (
    email: string,
    password: string
  ) => {
    client.auth.authenticate({
      email,
      password,
    })
    .then(() => {
      // customer is logged-in successfully
      // send authenticated requests now
      refetchCustomer()
    })
    .catch(() => {
      // an error occurred.
    })
  }

  // ...
}
```

<Note>

The refetch method is available through [Tanstack Query's useQuery hook](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery). It allows you to refetch data if a change occurs. In this case, you refetch the logged-in customer after authentication.

## Publishable API Key

Publishable API Keys allow you to send a request to Store API routes with a pre-defined scope. You can associate the publishable API key with one or more resources, such as sales channels, then include the publishable API key in the header of your requests.

The Medusa backend will infer the scope of the current request based on the publishable API key. At the moment, publishable API keys only work with sales channels.

It's highly recommended to create a publishable API key and pass it as an initialization option of the Medusa client.

You can learn more about publishable API keys and how to use them in [this documentation](../commerce-modules/sales-channel/publishable-api-keys/page.mdx).

### Create a Publishable API Key

{/* TODO add link [Medusa Admin](!user-guide!/settings/developer/api-key-management) */}

You can create a publishable API key either using the [Admin API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#publishable-api-keys), or using the Medusa Admin.

### Use a Publishable API Key

To use the publishable API key, pass it as a prop to the [MedusaProvider](/references/medusa-react/providers/medusa#medusaprovider).

For example:

```tsx
import { MedusaProvider } from "medusa-react"
import Storefront from "./Storefront"
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import React from "react"

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MedusaProvider
      queryClientProviderProps={{ client: queryClient }}
      baseUrl="http://localhost:9000"
      publishableApiKey={process.env.PUB_API_KEY}
    >
      <Storefront />
    </MedusaProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

---

## HTTP Compression

If you've enabled HTTP Compression in your Medusa backend configurations, and you want to disable it for your requests with Medusa React, you can pass the `x-no-compression` header in the `customHeaders` prop of the [MedusaProvider](/references/medusa-react/providers/medusa#medusaprovider).

For example:

```tsx
import { MedusaProvider } from "medusa-react"
import Storefront from "./Storefront"
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import React from "react"

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MedusaProvider
      queryClientProviderProps={{ client: queryClient }}
      baseUrl="http://localhost:9000"
      customHeaders={{
        "x-no-compression": true,
      }}
    >
      <Storefront />
    </MedusaProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

---

## Expanding Fields

In many hooks you'll find an `expand` property that can be accepted within one of the hooks's parameters. You can use the `expand` property to unpack an entity's relations and return them in the response.

<Note type="warning">

The relations you pass to `expand` replace any relations that are expanded by default in the request.

</Note>

### Expanding One Relation

For example, when you retrieve products, you can retrieve their collection by passing to the `expand` query parameter the value `collection`:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    expand: "collection",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

### Expanding Multiple Relations

You can expand more than one relation by separating the relations in the `expand` query parameter with a comma.

For example, to retrieve both the variants and the collection of products, pass to the `expand` query parameter the value `variants,collection`:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    expand: "variants,collection",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

### Prevent Expanding Relations

Some requests expand relations by default. You can prevent that by passing an empty expand value to retrieve an entity without any extra relations.

For example:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    expand: "",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

This would retrieve each product with only its properties, without any relations like `collection`.

---

## Selecting Fields

In many hooks you'll find a `fields` property that can be accepted within one of the hooks's parameters. You can use the `fields` property to specify which
fields in the entity should be returned in the response.

<Note type="warning">

If you pass a `fields` query parameter, only the fields you pass in the value along with the `id` of the entity will be returned in the response.

</Note>

The `fields` query parameter does not affect the expanded relations. You'll have to use the [Expand parameter](#expanding-fields) instead.

### Selecting One Field

For example, when you retrieve a list of products, you can retrieve only the titles of the products by passing `title` as a value to the `fields` query parameter:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    fields: "title",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

As mentioned above, the expanded relations such as `variants` will still be returned as they're not affected by the `fields` parameter.

You can ensure that only the `title` field is returned by passing an empty value to the `expand` query parameter. For example:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    fields: "title",
    expand: "",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

### Selecting Multiple Fields

You can pass more than one field by separating the field names in the `fields` query parameter with a comma.

For example, to select the `title` and `handle` of products:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    fields: "title,handle",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

### Retrieve Only the ID

You can pass an empty `fields` query parameter to return only the ID of an entity. 

For example:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    fields: "",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.id}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

You can also pair with an empty `expand` query parameter to ensure that the relations aren't retrieved as well. For example:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useAdminProducts({
    fields: "",
    expand: "",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.id}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

---

## Pagination

### Query Parameters

In listing hooks, such as list customers or list products, you can control the pagination using the query parameters `limit` and `offset`.

`limit` is used to specify the maximum number of items that can be return in the response. `offset` is used to specify how many items to skip before returning the resulting entities.

You can use the `offset` query parameter to change between pages. For example, if the limit is `50`, at page one the offset should be `0`; at page two the offset should be `50`, and so on.

For example, to limit the number of products retrieved:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { 
    products, 
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading,
  } = useAdminProducts({
    limit: 20,
    offset: 0,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

### Response Fields

In the response of listing hooks, aside from the entities retrieved, there are three pagination-related fields returned:

- `limit`: the maximum number of items that can be returned in the response.
- `offset`: the number of items that were skipped before the entities in the result.
- `count`: the total number of available items of this entity. It can be used to determine how many pages are there.

For example, if the `count` is `100` and the `limit` is `50`, you can divide the `count` by the `limit` to get the number of pages: `100/50 = 2 pages`.

### Sort Order

The `order` field, available on hooks supporting pagination, allows you to sort the retrieved items by an attribute of that item. For example, you can sort products by their `created_at` attribute by setting `order` to `created_at`:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { 
    products, 
    isLoading,
  } = useAdminProducts({
    order: "created_at",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

By default, the sort direction will be ascending. To change it to descending, pass a dash (`-`) before the attribute name. For example:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { 
    products, 
    isLoading,
  } = useAdminProducts({
    order: "-created_at",
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {products && !products.length && <span>No Products</span>}
      {products && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Products
```

This sorts the products by their `created_at` attribute in the descending order.
