<Note type="soon">

The following deployment guide doesn't support Medusa v2 yet.

</Note>

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allows you to easily deploy your applications in the cloud.

Alternatively, you can use this button to deploy the Medusa application to Heroku directly:

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-starter-default/tree/feat/deploy-heroku">
  <img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Heroku" className="mb-1" />
</a>

<Note type="check">

- Production Event Bus Module installed and configured in the Medusa application, such as the [Redis Event Bus Module](../../../architectural-modules/event/redis/page.mdx).
- Production Cache Module installed and configured in the Medusa application, such as the [Redis Cache Module](../../../architectural-modules/cache/redis/page.mdx).
- [Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/).
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
- [GitHub repository with the Medusa application's code](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

</Note>

## Configure the Admin

If you're using the Medusa Admin plugin, you have two options to deploy it: either with the Medusa application or separately.

### Deploying with the Medusa Application

To deploy the Medusa Admin with the Medusa application:

1. Your chosen plan must offer at least 2GB of RAM.
2. Enable the autoRebuild option of the admin plugin:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["7"]]}
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      autoRebuild: true,
      // other options...
    },
  },
]
```

Alternatively, you can use a GitHub action to build the admin as explained [here](!docs!/deployment).

### Deploying Separately

To deploy the admin separately, disable the admin plugin's serve option:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["10"]]}
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      // only enable `serve` in development
      // you may need to add the NODE_ENV variable
      // manually
      serve: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
      // other options...
    },
  },
]
```

This ensures that the admin isn't built or served in production. You can also change `@medusajs/admin` dependency to be a dev dependency in `package.json`.

You can alternatively remove the admin plugin for the plugins array.

## Deploy to Heroku

### Login to Heroku from your CLI

Before you can create an app with Heroku, you must login with the CLI tool:

```bash
heroku login
```

Follow the instructions to log in.

### Create an App with Heroku

In the root directory of your Medusa application, run the following commands to create an app on Heroku and add it as a remote origin:

```bash
heroku create medusa-app
heroku git:remote -a medusa-app
```

Where `medusa-app` is the name of the heroku app you're creating. You can use any name you want.

### Add PostgreSQL Add-On

Add a PostgreSQL add-on to your Heroku app with the following command:

```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:mini
```

This uses Heroku Postgres's smallest plan. Check out [the available plans and pricing of Heroku Postgres on Heroku's website.](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql#pricing)

<Note title="Tip">

The Heroku PostgreSQL add-on automatically adds the connection URL in the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. If you use a different PostgreSQL , make sure to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

</Note>

### Add Redis Add-On

Add a Redis instance to your Heroku app with the following command:

```bash
heroku addons:create stackhero-redis:ist-m4euc0
```

This uses the lowest plan in Stackhero Redis. Check out [the plans and pricing of Stackhero Redis on Heroku's website.](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/stackhero-redis#pricing)

To retrieve the Redis connection URL and use it later to set it as an environment variable, run the following command:

```bash
heroku config:get STACKHERO_REDIS_URL_TLS
```

### Note about Modules

If you use modules that require setting up other resources, add them at this point.

### Configure Environment Variables on Heroku

Run the following commands in the root directory of your Medusa application to set necessary environment variables:

```bash
heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret
heroku config:set COOKIE_SECRET=your-super-secret-pt2
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
heroku config:set REDIS_URL="{redis_url}"
```

Make sure to replace `{redis_url}` with the Redis connection URL.

You can also add other environment variables for the modules you're using here.

<Note type="warning">

It’s highly recommended to use strong, randomly generated secrets for `JWT_SECRET` and `COOKIE_SECRET`.

</Note>

### Set Buildpack

Set the buildpack to Node.js using the following command:

```bash
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
```

### Changes to package.json

Update the `scripts` in `package.json` to include the following scripts:

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
    // other scripts
    "serve": "medusa start",
    "heroku-postbuild": "medusa migrations run",
    "prepare": "npm run build",
},
```

### Changes to medusa-config.js

Add to the `projectConfig` property in the exported object a new property `databaseExtra`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    databaseExtra: { ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } },
  },
}
```

### Push Changes

Finally, commit and push all changes to Heroku:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Medusa Application on Heroku"
git push heroku HEAD:master
```

This triggers a redeployment of the Medusa application with all the new configurations.

---

## Test the Deployed Application

To test your deployed Medusa application, run the following command to retrieve the application's URL:

```bash
heroku apps:info -a medusa-app
```

Where `medusa-app` is the name of the app. You should see as the output a bunch of info of the app.

The Medusa application's URL is available under "Web URL". Copy it and perform requests to it to test it out.

For example, send a request to `{your_app_url}/store/products` which returns the products in your store.

### Health Route

Access `/health` to get health status of your deployed Medusa application.

### Testing the Medusa Admin

If you deployed the [Medusa Admin with the Medusa Application](#deploying-with-the-medusa-application), you can test it by opening `{your_app_url}/app` in the browser. If you changed the admin path, make sure to change `/app` to the path you've set.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Inspect Build Logs

If an error occurs during the deployment, run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa application to view the Heroku logs:

```bash
heroku logs -n 500000 --remote heroku --tail -a medusa-app
```

Where `medusa-app` is the name of the app.

### Error: Babel not found

If you get the following error in the logs of your application:

```bash
/bin/sh: 1: /app/node_modules/.bin/babel: not found
```

Create the file `Procfile` in the root directory of your Medusa application with the following content:

```
web: npm run serve
```

Then, push the changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Procfile"
git push heroku HEAD:master
```

Once the application is redeployed, the error is resolved.

---

## Run Commands on Your Medusa Application

To run commands on your deployed Medusa application, use the following command:

```bash
heroku run -a medusa-app -- {command}
```

Where `medusa-app` is the name of the app and `{command}` is the command you want to run.

### Create Admin User

For example, to create an admin user, run the following command:

```bash
heroku run -a medusa-app -- npx medusa user -e "<EMAIL>" -p "<PASSWORD>"
```

Where `medusa-app` is the name of your Heroku app, and `<EMAIL>` and `<PASSWORD>` are the credentials you want to use to log in to the Medusa Admin.
