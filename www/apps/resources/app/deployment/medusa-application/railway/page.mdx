# {metadata.title}

In this document, you’ll learn how to deploy your Medusa application to [Railway](https://railway.app/).

<Note title="Important">

As Medusa v2 is still in active development, it's highly recommended not to deploy it for production purposes.

</Note>

## What You’ll Deploy

1. PostgreSQL database.
2. Redis database.
3. Medusa application in server mode.
4. Medusa application in worker mode.
5. (Optional) Medusa Admin.

<Note>

The same Medusa project is used to deploy the server and worker modes. Learn more about the `workerMode` configuration in [this document](/references/medusa-config#workermode).

</Note>

<Note type="check">

- [Medusa application](!docs!) hosted in a GitHub repository.

</Note>

## 1. Configure Medusa Application

### Worker Mode

The `workerMode` configuration determines which mode the Medusa application runs in. As mentioned at the beginning of this guide, you’ll deploy two Medusa applications: one in server mode, and one in worker mode.

So, add the following configuration in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    workerMode: process.env.MEDUSA_WORKER_MODE
  },
})

```

Later, you’ll set different values of the `MEDUSA_WORKER_MODE` environment variable for each Medusa application deployment.

### Configure Medusa Admin

There are two cases where you may disable the Medusa Admin in your deployed Medusa application:

1. If you choose to host it separately.
2. In the Medusa application running in worker mode, as it doesn’t need to run the admin.

<Note>

To host the admin with the Medusa application, the hosting provider and plan should offer at least 2GB of RAM.

</Note>

Add the following configuration in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    disable: process.env.DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN === "true"
  }
})

```

Later, you’ll set different values of the `DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN` environment variable.

### Configure Redis URL

Add the following configuration in `medusa-config.js` :

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL
  },
})

```

---

## 2. Add predeploy Script

Before you start the Medusa application in production, you should always run migrations and sync links.

So, add the following script in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "predeploy": "medusa migrations run && medusa links sync"
},
```

---

## 3. Install Production Modules and Providers

By default, your Medusa application uses modules and providers useful for development, such as the In-Memory Cache Module or the Local File Module Provider.

It’s highly recommended to instead install modules and providers suitable for production, including:

- [Redis Cache Module](../../../architectural-modules/cache/redis/page.mdx)
- [Redis Event Bus Module](../../../architectural-modules/event/redis/page.mdx)
- [Workflow Engine Redis Module](../../../architectural-modules/workflow-engine/redis/page.mdx)
- [S3 File Module Provider](../../../architectural-modules/file/s3/page.mdx) (or other file module providers production-ready).
- [SendGrid Notification Module Provider](../../../architectural-modules/notification/sendgrid/page.mdx) (or other notification module providers production-ready).

For example, add the following dependencies in `package.json` for the Cache, Event Bus, and Workflow Engine modules:

```json
"dependencies": {
  // ...
  "@medusajs/cache-redis": "preview",
  "@medusajs/event-bus-redis": "preview",
  "@medusajs/workflow-engine-redis": "preview"
}
```

Then, add these modules in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
import { Modules } from '@medusajs/utils'

module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: {
    // ...
    [Modules.CACHE]: {
      resolve: "@medusajs/cache-redis",
      options: { 
        redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,
      },
    },
    [Modules.EVENT_BUS]: {
      resolve: "@medusajs/event-bus-redis",
      options: { 
        redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,
      },
    },
    [Modules.WORKFLOW_ENGINE]: {
      resolve: "@medusajs/workflow-engine-redis",
      options: {
        redis: {
          url: process.env.REDIS_URL,
        },
      },
    }
  }
})
```

<Note title="Tip">

Check out the [Integrations](../../../integrations/page.mdx) and [Architectural Modules](../../../architectural-modules/page.mdx) documentation for other modules and providers to use.

## 4. Create Railway Project and Host PostgreSQL Database

<Note>

Push all changes you’ve made in the previous step to the GitHub repository before proceeding.

</Note>

To create a Railway project:

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/), and log in or create an account.
2. In your account dashboard, click the New Project button.
3. Choose Database → Deploy PostgreSQL

This creates a new project with just a PostgreSQL database. You’ll add more services in the next steps.

---

## 5. Add Redis Database to Project

To add a Redis database service to your project:

1. Click on the Create button at the top right.
2. Choose Database → Add Redis

---

## 6. Deploy the Medusa Application in Server Mode

In this section, you’ll add a Medusa application service in server mode to the Railway project, configure, and deploy it.

### Create Service

To create the service for the Medusa application in server mode:

1. Click on the Create button.
2. Choose GitHub Repo.
3. Choose the repository of your Medusa application.

This adds a new service to your project.

### Add Environment Variables

To add environment variables to the Medusa application in server mode:

1. Click on its card in the project dashboard.
2. Choose the Variables tab.
3. Click on RAW Editor, and paste the following in the editor:

```bash
COOKIE_SECRET=supersecret # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
JWT_SECRET=supersecret  # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
STORE_CORS= # STOREFRONT URL
ADMIN_CORS= # ADMIN URL
AUTH_CORS= # STOREFRONT AND ADMIN URLS, SEPARATED BY COMMAS
# change to false if you're hosting the admin with the application
DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN=true
MEDUSA_WORKER_MODE=worker
PORT=9000
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL}}
POSTGRES_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL}}
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_PUBLIC_URL}}
```

Where:

- The value of `COOKIE_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` must be a randomly generated secret.
- `STORE_CORS`'s value is the URL of your storefront. If you don’t have it yet, you can skip adding it for now.
- `ADMIN_CORS`'s value is the URL of the admin dashboard. If you don’t have it yet, or you’re deploying the admin with the Medusa application, you can skip adding it for now.
- `AUTH_CORS`'s value is the URLs of any application authenticating users, customers, or other actor types, such as the storefront and admin URLs. The URLs are separated by commas. If you don’t have the URLs yet, you can set its value later.
- Change `DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN` to `false` if you’re hosting the admin with the Medusa application.

Feel free to add any other relevant environment variables. Once you’re done, click the Update Variables button.

### Set Start Command

To set the `start` command of your Medusa application in server mode:

1. Click on its card in the project dashboard.
2. Choose the Settings tab.
3. Scroll down to the Deploy section.
4. For the “Custom Start Command” field, enter the following and click the check mark button:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run redeploy && npm run start
```

### Deploy Changes

To deploy the changes of the Medusa application in server mode, click on the Deploy button at the top center of the project. This takes a couple of minutes.

### Set Domain Name

You can either generate a random domain name or set a custom one. To do that:

1. Click on the Medusa application running in server mode.
2. Choose the Settings tab.
3. Scroll down to the Networking section.
4. Under Public Networking, click on Generate domain to generate a domain name or Custom domain to add your custom domain.
    1. Choose the `9000` port.
5. Save the changes.

### Additional Configuration if Deploying with Admin

If you’re deploying the Medusa application in server mode with the admin, you have to make some changes now that you’ve obtained the application’s URL.

First, add the following configuration to `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    // ...
    backendUrl: process.env.MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL
  },
})
```

Then, push the changes to the GitHub repository.

In Railway, add / modify the following environment variables for the Medusa application in server mode:

```bash
ADMIN_CORS= # MEDUSA APPLICATION URL
AUTH_CORS= # ADD MEDUSA APPLICATION URL
MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL= # MEDUSA APPLICATION URL
```

Where you set the value of `ADMIN_CORS` and `MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL` to the Medusa application’s URL you got from the previous step, and you add the URL to `AUTH_CORS`.

<Note title="Tip">

Remember to separate URLs in `AUTH_CORS` by commas.

</Note>

## 7. Deploy the Medusa Application in Worker Mode

In this section, you’ll add the Medusa application in worker mode to the Railway project, configure, and deploy it.

The process is similar to deploying the application in server mode, with slight changes in the configuration.

### Create Service

To create the service for the Medusa application in worker mode:

1. Click on the Create button.
2. Choose GitHub Repo.
3. Choose the repository of your Medusa application.

This adds a new service to your project.

### Add Environment Variables

To add environment variables to the Medusa application in worker mode:

1. Click on its card in the project dashboard.
2. Choose the Variables tab.
3. Click on RAW Editor, and paste the following in the editor:

```bash
COOKIE_SECRET=supersecret # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
JWT_SECRET=supersecret  # TODO GENERATE SECURE SECRET
DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN=false
MEDUSA_WORKER_MODE=worker
PORT=9000
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL}}
POSTGRES_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL}}
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_PUBLIC_URL}}
```

Where:

- The value of `COOKIE_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` must be a randomly generated secret.
- Keep `DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN`'s value set to `true`, even if you’re hosting the admin with the Medusa application.

Feel free to add any other relevant environment variables. Once you’re done, click the Update Variables button.

### Set Start Command

To set the `start` command of your Medusa application in worker mode:

1. Click on its card in the project dashboard.
2. Choose the Settings tab.
3. Scroll down to the Deploy section.
4. For the “Custom Start Command” field, enter the following and click the check mark button:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run start
```

### Deploy Changes

To deploy the changes of the Medusa application in working mode, click on the Deploy button at the top center of the project. This takes a couple of minutes.

---

## 8. Test Deployed Application

To test out the deployed application, go to `<APP_URL>/health`, where `<APP_URL>` is the URL of the Medusa application in server mode. If the deployment was successful, you’ll see the `OK` response.

### Open Deployed Medusa Admin

If you deployed the Medusa Admin with the application, it’ll be available at `<APP_URL>/app`.

---

## Create Admin User

To create an admin user, install the [Railway CLI tool](https://docs.railway.app/guides/cli). Then, log in and link the Railway project to the local directory of the Medusa application.

<Note>

Make sure to link it to the Railway service of the Medusa application in server mode.

</Note>

Then, in your local directory of the Medusa application, run the following command:

```bash
railway run npx medusa user -e admin-medusa@test.com -p supersecret
```

Replace the email `admin-medusa@test.com` and password `supersecret` with the credentials you want.

You can use these credentials to log into the Medusa Admin dashboard.

---

## Troubleshooting

To check issues or errors in your deployed Medusa application:

1. Click on the card of the Medusa application in server mode.
2. Click on the Deployments tab.
3. Click on the View Logs button.
