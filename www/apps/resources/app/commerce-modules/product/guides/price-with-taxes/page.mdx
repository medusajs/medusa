In this document, you'll learn how to calculate a product variant's price with taxes.

## Step 0: Resolve Resources

You'll need the following resources for the taxes calculation:

1. Remote query to retrieve the product's variants' prices for a context. Learn more about that in [this guide](../price/page.mdx).
2. The Tax Module's main service to get the tax lines for each product.

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  ModuleRegistrationName
} from "@medusajs/utils"

// In an API route, workflow step, etc...
const remoteQuery = container.resolve("remoteQuery")
const taxModuleService = container.resolve(
  ModuleRegistrationName.TAX
)
```

---

## Step 1: Retrieve Prices for a Context

After resolving the resources, use the remote query to retrieve the products with the variants' prices for a context:

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  remoteQueryObjectFromString,
} from "@medusajs/utils"

// ...
const query = remoteQueryObjectFromString({
  entryPoint: "product",
  fields: [
    "*",
    "variants.*",
    "variants.calculated_price.*"
  ],
  variables: {
    filters: {
      id
    },
    "variants.calculated_price": {
      context: {
        region_id,
        currency_code,
      }
    }
  }
})

const products = await remoteQuery(query)
```

## Step 2: Get Tax Lines for Products

To retrieve the tax line of each product, first, add the following utility method:

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  HttpTypes,
  TaxableItemDTO
} from "@medusajs/types"

// ...
const asTaxItem = (product: HttpTypes.StoreProduct): TaxableItemDTO[] => {
  return product.variants
    ?.map((variant) => {
      if (!variant.calculated_price) {
        return
      }

      return {
        id: variant.id,
        product_id: product.id,
        product_name: product.title,
        product_categories: product.categories?.map((c) => c.name),
        product_category_id: product.categories?.[0]?.id,
        product_sku: variant.sku,
        product_type: product.type,
        product_type_id: product.type_id,
        quantity: 1,
        unit_price: variant.calculated_price.calculated_amount,
        currency_code: variant.calculated_price.currency_code,
      }
    })
    .filter((v) => !!v) as unknown as TaxableItemDTO[]
}
```

This formats the products as items to calculate tax lines for.

Then, use it when retrieving the tax lines of the products retrieved earlier:

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  ItemTaxLineDTO
} from "@medusajs/types"

// ...
const taxLines = (await taxModuleService.getTaxLines(
  products.map(asTaxItem).flat(),
  {
    // example of context properties. You can pass other ones.
    address: {
      country_code,
    }
  }
)) as unknown as ItemTaxLineDTO[]
```

You use the Tax Module's main service's [getTaxLines method](/references/tax/getTaxLines) to retrieve the tax line. 

For the first parameter, you use the `asTaxItem` function to format the products as expected by the `getTaxLines` method.

For the second parameter, you pass the current context. You can pass other details such as the customer's ID.

<Note>

Learn about the other context properties to pass in [the getTaxLines method's reference](/references/tax/getTaxLines).

## Step 3: Calculate Price with Tax for Variant

To calculate the price with and without taxes for a variant, first, group the tax lines retrieved in the previous step by variant IDs:

export const taxLineHighlights = [
  ["3", "variantId", "The variant's ID is stored in the `line_item_id` property since tax lines are for cart items."]
]

```ts highlights={taxLineHighlights}
const taxLinesMap = new Map<string, ItemTaxLineDTO[]>()
taxLines.forEach((taxLine) => {
  const variantId = taxLine.line_item_id
  if (!taxLinesMap.has(variantId)) {
    taxLinesMap.set(variantId, [])
  }

  taxLinesMap.get(variantId)?.push(taxLine)
})
```

Notice that the variant's ID is stored in the `line_item_id` property of a tax line since tax lines are used for line items in a cart.

Then, loop over the products and their variants to retrieve the prices with and without taxes:

export const calculateTaxHighlights = [
  ["13", "taxLinesForVariant", "Retrieve the variant's tax line from the map."],
  ["14", "priceWithTax", "The product variant's price with taxes applied."],
  ["14", "priceWithoutTax", "The product variant's price without taxes applied."],
  ["14", "calculateAmountsWithTax", "Use utility to calculate prices with and without taxes."]
]

```ts highlights={calculateTaxHighlights}
// other imports...
import {
  calculateAmountsWithTax
} from "@medusajs/utils"

// ...
products.forEach((product) => {
  product.variants?.forEach((variant) => {
    if (!variant.calculated_price) {
      return
    }

    const taxLinesForVariant = taxLinesMap.get(variant.id) || []
    const { priceWithTax, priceWithoutTax } = calculateAmountsWithTax({
      taxLines: taxLinesForVariant,
      amount: variant.calculated_price!.calculated_amount!,
      includesTax:
        variant.calculated_price!.is_calculated_price_tax_inclusive!,
    })

    // do something with prices...
  })
})
```

For each product variant, you:

1. Retrieve its tax lines from the `taxLinesMap`.
2. Calculate its prices with and without taxes using the `calculateAmountsWithTax` function imported from `@medusajs/utils`.
3. The `calculateAmountsWithTax` function returns an object having two properties:
    - `priceWithTax`: The variant's price with the taxes applied.
    - `priceWithoutTax`: The variant's price without taxes applied.
