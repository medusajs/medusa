In this document, learn how to create an actor type and authenticate its associated data model.

## 0. Create Module with Data Model

Before creating an actor type, you must define a data model the actor type belongs to. The data model is defined in a custom module.

The rest of this guide uses this `Manager` data model as an example:

```ts title="src/modules/manager/models/manager.ts"
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const Manager = model.define("manager", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  firstName: model.text(),
  lastName: model.text(),
  email: model.text(),
})

export default Manager
```

---

## 1. Create Workflow

Start by creating a workflow that does two things:

- Create a record of the `Manager` data model.
- Sets the `app_metadata` property of the associated `AuthIdentity` record based on the new actor type.

For example, create the file `src/workflows/create-manager.ts`. with the following content:

export const workflowHighlights = [
  ["27", "createManagerStep", "Thi step creates a manager."],
  ["44", "createManagerWorkflow", "The workflow used to create a manager and set its auth identity's actor type."],
  ["53", "setAuthAppMetadataStep", "Set the actor type of the manager's associated auth identity."],
  ["55", '"manager"', "The actor type of the manager."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/create-manager.ts" highlights={workflowHighlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { 
  setAuthAppMetadataStep,
} from "@medusajs/core-flows"
import ManagerModuleService from "../modules/manager/service"

type CreateManagerWorkflowInput = {
  manager: {
    first_name: string
    last_name: string
    email: string
  }
  authIdentityId: string
}

type CreateManagerWorkflowOutput = {
  id: string
  first_name: string
  last_name: string
  email: string
}

const createManagerStep = createStep(
  "create-manager-step",
  async ({ 
    manager: managerData,
  }: Pick<CreateManagerWorkflowInput, "manager">, 
  { container }) => {
    const managerModuleService: ManagerModuleService = 
      container.resolve("managerModuleService")

    const manager = await managerModuleService.createManager(
      managerData
    )

    return new StepResponse(manager)
  }
)

const createManagerWorkflow = createWorkflow<
  CreateManagerWorkflowInput, CreateManagerWorkflowOutput
>(
  "create-manager",
  function (input) {
    const manager = createManagerStep({
      manager: input.manager,
    })

    setAuthAppMetadataStep({
      authIdentityId: input.authIdentityId,
      actorType: "manager",
      value: manager.id,
    })

    return manager
  }
)

export default createManagerWorkflow
```

This workflow accepts the manager’s data and the associated auth identity’s ID as inputs. The next sections explain how the auth identity ID is retrieved.

The workflow has two steps:

1. Create the manager using the `createManagerStep`.
2. Set the `app_metadata` property of the associated auth identity using the `setAuthAppMetadataStep` step imported from `@medusajs/core-flows`. You specify the actor type `manager` in the `actorType` property of the step’s input.

---

## 2. Define the Create API Route

Next, you’ll use the workflow defined in the previous section in an API route that creates a manager.

So, create the file `src/api/manager/route.ts` with the following content:

export const createRouteHighlights = [
  ["15", "AuthenticatedMedusaRequest", "The request must be authenticated to associate the manager with an auth identity."],
  ["27", "createManagerWorkflow", "Use the workflow created previously to create the manager."],
  ["31", "auth_identity_id", "Access the associated auth identity's ID in `req.auth_context.auth_identity_id`."]
]

```ts title="src/api/manager/route.ts" highlights={createRouteHighlights}
import type { 
  AuthenticatedMedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { MedusaError } from "@medusajs/utils"
import createManagerWorkflow from "../../workflows/create-manager"

type RequestBody = {
  first_name: string
  last_name: string
  email: string
}

export async function POST(
  req: AuthenticatedMedusaRequest<RequestBody>, 
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  // If `actor_id` is present, the request carries 
  // authentication for an existing manager
  if (req.auth_context.actor_id) {
    throw new MedusaError(
      MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
      "Request already authenticated as a manager."
    )
  }

  const { result } = await createManagerWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run({
      input: {
        manager: req.body,
        authIdentityId: req.auth_context.auth_identity_id,
      },
    })
  
    res.status(200).json({ manager: result })
}
```

Since the manager must be associated with an `AuthIdentity` record, the request is expected to be authenticated, even if the manager isn’t created yet. This can be achieved by:

1. Obtaining a token usng the [/auth route](../authentication-route/page.mdx).
2. Passing the token in the bearer header of the request to this route.

In the API route, you create the manager using the workflow from the previous section and return it in the response.

---

## 3. Apply the `authenticate` Middleware

The last step is to apply the `authenticate` middleware on the API routes that require a manager’s authentication.

To do that, create the file `src/api/middlewares.ts` with the following content:

export const middlewareHighlights = [
  ["9", "authenticate", "Require the user to be authenticated to access the `/manager` API route when sending a `POST` request."],
  ["10", "allowUnregistered", "The user doesn't need to be registered to access the API route."],
  ["17", "authenticate", "Require the user to be authenticated as a manager when accessing `/manager/me` API routes."]
]

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts" highlights={middlewareHighlights}
import { MiddlewaresConfig, authenticate } from "@medusajs/medusa"

export const config: MiddlewaresConfig = {
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/manager",
      method: "POST",
      middlewares: [
        authenticate("manager", ["session", "bearer"], {
          allowUnregistered: true,
        }),
      ],
    },
    {
      matcher: "/manager/me*",
      middlewares: [
        authenticate("manager", ["session", "bearer"]),
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

This applies middlewares on two route patterns:

1. The `authenticate` middleware is applied on the `/manager` API route for `POST` requests while allowing unregistered managers. This requires that a bearer token be passed in the request to access the manager’s auth identity but doesn’t require the manager to be registered.
2. The `authenticate` middleware is applied on all routes starting with `/manager/me`, restricting these routes to authenticated managers only.

### Retrieve Manager API Route

For example, create the file `src/api/manager/me/route.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/api/manager/me/route.ts"
import { 
  AuthenticatedMedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import ManagerModuleService from "../../../modules/manager/service"

export async function GET(
  req: AuthenticatedMedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
): Promise<void> {
  const managerModuleService: ManagerModuleService = 
    req.scope.resolve("managerModuleService")

  const manager = await managerModuleService.retrieveManager(
    req.auth_context.actor_id
  )

  res.json({ manager })
}
```

This route is only accessible by authenticated managers. You access the manager’s ID using `req.auth_context.actor_id`.

## Test Custom Actor Type Authentication Flow

To authenticate managers:

1. Send a `POST` request to `/auth/manager/emailpass` to create an auth identity for the manager:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/auth/manager/emailpass' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "manager@gmail.com",
    "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

Copy the returned token to use it in the next request.

2. Send a `POST` request to `/manager` to create a manager:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/manager' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
--data-raw '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "manager@gmail.com"
}'
```

Replace `{token}` with the token returned in the previous step.

3. Send a `POST` request to `/auth/manager/emailpass` again to retrieve an authenticated token for the manager:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/auth/manager/emailpass' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "manager@gmail.com",
    "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

4. You can now send authenticated requests as a manager. For example, send a `GET` request to `/manager/me` to retrieve the authenticated manager’s details:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9000/manager/me' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

Whenever you want to log in as a manager, use the `/auth/manager/emailpass` API route, as explained in step 3.
