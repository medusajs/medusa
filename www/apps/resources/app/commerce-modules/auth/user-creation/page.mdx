In this document, you’ll learn about the user-creation flow and how to use it with the User Module.

## Auth User Creation in Authentication Flow

In the [Auth Provider](../auth-providers/page.mdx) documentation, you learned about the authentication flows supported by the Auth Module. These flows are used when an `AuthIdentity` is already available for the specified authentication data, such as email/password credentials.

However, the `emailpass` and `google` providers support creating an `AuthIdentity` if none exists. If an email is provided that doesn’t have an `AuthIdentity` associated with it (checked via its `entity_id` field) for the specified provider (checked via its `provider` field), a new `AuthIdentity` is created for that email and provider.

![Diagram showcasing the AuthIdentity creation part of the authentication flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1711441638/Medusa%20Resources/auth-user-creation_gmahvl.jpg)

So, by default, your authentication flow supports both sign-in and sign-up flows.

<Note title="Tip">

This step actually occurs at different points of the authentication flow for each of the providers. For the `emailpass` provider, it occurs before checking that the password is correct. For the `google` provider, you must go through the full authentication flow to retrieve the user details, such as email, from Google.

## Creating a User in the User Module

The User Module provides user and invite management functionalities. However, it doesn’t provide authentication functionalities or store any related data.

By combining the User and Auth Modules, you can use the Auth Module for authenticating users, and the User Module to manage those users.

So, when a user is authenticated, and you receive the `AuthIdentity` object, you can use it to create a user if it doesn’t exist:

```ts
const { success, authIdentity } =
  await authModuleService.authenticate("emailpass", {
    // ...
  })

// assuming authIdentity is defined
const [, count] = await userModuleService.listAndCount({
  email: authIdentity.entity_id,
})

if (!count) {
  const user = await userModuleService.create({
    email: authIdentity.entity_id,
  })
}
```
