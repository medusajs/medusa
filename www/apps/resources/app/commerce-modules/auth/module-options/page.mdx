In this document, you'll learn about the options of the Auth Module.

## providers

The `providers` option is an array of auth module providers.

When the Medusa application starts, these providers are registered and can be used to handle authentication.

<Note title="Tip">

By default, the `emailpass` provider is registered to authenticate customers and admin users.

</Note>

For example:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

// ...

module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/auth",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/auth-emailpass",
            id: "emailpass",
            options: {
              // provider options...
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ]
})
```

The `providers` option is an array of objects that accept the following properties:

- `resolve`: A string indicating the package name of the module provider or the path to it relative to the `src` directory.
- `id`: A string indicating the provider's unique name or ID.
- `options`: An optional object of the module provider's options.

## Auth CORS

The Medusa application's authentication API routes are defined under the `/auth` prefix that requires setting the `authCors` property of the `http` configuration.

By default, the Medusa application you created will have an `AUTH_CORS` environment variable, which is used as the value of `authCors`.

Refer to [Medusa's configuration guide](/references/medusa-config#authCors) to learn more about the `authCors` configuration.

## authMethodsPerActor Configuration

The Medusa application's configuration accept an `authMethodsPerActor` configuration which restricts the allowed auth providers used with an actor type.

Learn more about the `authMethodsPerActor` configuration in [this guide](../auth-providers/page.mdx#configure-allowed-auth-providers-of-actor-types).
