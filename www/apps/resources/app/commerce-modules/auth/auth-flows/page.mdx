In this document, you'll learn about how the Auth Provider is used in an authentication flow.

## How to Authenticate a User

To authenticate a user, you use the `authenticate` method of the Auth Module's main service (`IAuthModuleService`). For example:

```ts
const data = await authModuleService.authenticate(
  "emailpass",
  // passed to auth provider
  {
    // ...
  }
)
```

This method calls the `authenticate` method of the specified provider and returns its data.

<Note>

Learn about the parameters and return type of the `IAuthModuleService`'s `authenticate` method in [this reference](/references/auth/authenticate).

</Note>

## Basic Authentication Flow

If the `authenticate` method returns the following object:

```ts
data = {
	success: true,
	authIdentity: {
    // ...
  },
}
```

Then, the user is authenticated successfully, and their authentication details are available within the `authIdentity` object.

<Note>

Learn more about the `authIdentity` in [this guide](../persisting-auth-user/page.mdx#what-is-an-authuser).

## Authentication with Third-Party Service Flow

If the `authenticate` method returns the following object:

```ts
data = {
	success: true,
	location: "https://....",
}
```

It means the authentication process requires the user to perform an action with a third-party service. For example, when using the `google` provider, the user goes to the URL specified in the `location`'s value to log in with their Google account.

### validateCallback

Providers handling this authentication flow must implement the `validateCallback` method. It implements the logic to validate the authentication with the third-party service.

So, once the user performs the required action, the third-party service must redirect to an API route that uses the `validateCallback` method of the `IAuthModuleService`. The method calls the specified provider’s `validateCallback` method passing it the authentication details it received in the second parameter:

```ts
const data = await authModuleService.validateCallback(
    "google",
    // passed to auth provider
    {
      // ...
    }
  )
```

<Note>

Learn more about the parameters and return type of the `IAuthModuleService`'s `validateCallback` method in [this reference](/references/auth/validateCallback).

</Note>

If the authentication is successful, the auth provider’s `validateCallback` method returns the same data as the basic authentication:

```ts
data = {
	success: true,
	authIdentity: {
    // ...
  },
}
```
