In this document, you’ll learn how an order and its details are versioned.

## What's Versioning?

Versioning means assigning a version number to a record, such as an order and its items. This is useful to view the different versions of the order following changes in its lifetime.

## version Property

The `Order` and `OrderSummary` data models have a `version` property that indicates the current version. By default, its value is `1`.

Other order-related data models, such as `OrderItem`, also has a `version` property, but it indicates the version it belongs to.

## How the Version Changes

When the order is changed, such as an item is exchanged, this changes the version of the order and its related data:

1. The version of the order and its summary is incremented.
2. Related order data that have a `version` property, such as the `OrderItem`, are duplicated. The duplicated item has the new version, whereas the original item has the previous version.

When the order is retrieved, only the related data having the same version is retrieved.
