In this document, you’ll learn about order returns.

## What is a Return?

A return is the return of items delivered to the customer back to the merchant. It is represented by the [Return data model](/references/order/models/Return).

A return is requested either by the customer or the merchant, supporting an automated Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) flow.

Once the merchant receives the returned items, they mark the return as received.

## Returned Items

The items to be returned are represented by the [ReturnItem data model](references/order/models/ReturnItem).

---

## Return Shipping Methods

A return has shipping methods used to return the items to the merchant. The shipping methods are represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](references/order/models/OrderShippingMethod).

---

## Refund Payment

The `refund_amount` property of the `Return` data model holds the amount a merchant must refund the customer.

The [Transaction data model](references/order/models/Transaction) represents the refunds made for the return.

---

## Returns in Exchanges and Claims

When a merchant creates an exchange or a claim, it includes returning items from the customer.

The `Return` data model also represents the return of these items. In this case, the return is associated with the exchange or claim it was created for.
