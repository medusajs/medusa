In this document, you’ll learn about tax lines in an order.

## What are Tax Lines?

A tax line indicates the tax rate of a line item or a shipping method. The [LineItemTaxLine data model](/references/order/models/LineItemTaxLine) represents a line item’s tax line, and the [ShippingMethodTaxLine data model](/references/order/models/ShippingMethodTaxLine) represents a shipping method’s tax line.

## Tax Inclusivity

By default, the tax amount is calculated by taking the tax rate from the line item or shipping method’s amount and then adding it to the item/method’s subtotal.

However, line items and shipping methods have an `is_tax_inclusive` field that, when enabled, indicates that the item or method’s price already includes taxes.

So, instead of calculating the tax rate and adding it to the item/method’s subtotal, it’s calculated as part of the subtotal.

The following diagram is a simplified showcase of how a subtotal is calculated from the tax perspective.
