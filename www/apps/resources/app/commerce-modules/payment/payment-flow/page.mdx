In this document, you’ll learn how to implement an accept-payment flow.

## Flow Overview

## 1. Create a Payment Collection

The payment collection holds all details related to a resource’s payment operations. So, you start off by creating a payment collection.

For example:

```ts
const paymentCollection =
  await paymentModuleService.createPaymentCollections({
    region_id: "reg_123",
    currency_code: "usd",
    amount: 5000,
  })
```

You can then link the payment collection to another resource, such as a cart in the Cart Module.

<Note>

## 2. Create Payment Sessions

The payment collection has one or more payment sessions, each being a payment amount to be authorized by a payment provider.

So, after creating the payment collection, create at least one payment session for a provider.

For example:

```ts
const paymentSession =
  await paymentModuleService.createPaymentSession(
    paymentCollection.id,
    {
      provider_id: "stripe",
      currency_code: "usd",
      amount: 5000,
      data: {
        // any necessary data for the
        // payment provider
      },
    }
  )
```

You can also create payment sessions for every supported payment provider to allow customers to choose from them.

<Note>

Learn more about the `createPaymentSession` method in [this reference](/references/payment/createPaymentSession).

## 3. Authorize Payment Session

Once the customer chooses a payment session, start the authorization process. This may involve some action performed by the third-party payment provider, such as entering a 3DS code.

For example:

```ts
const payment =
  await paymentModuleService.authorizePaymentSession(
    paymentSession.id,
    {}
  )
```

When the payment authorization is successful, a payment is created and returned.

<Note>

Learn more about the `authorizePaymentSession` method in [this reference](/references/payment/authorizePaymentSession).

</Note>

### Handling Additional Action

If the payment authorization isn’t successful, either because it requires additional action or for another reason, the method updates the payment session with the new status and throws an error.

In that case, you can catch that error and, if there are required actions, handle them accordingly, then retry the authorization.

For example:

```ts
try {
  const payment =
    await paymentModuleService.authorizePaymentSession(
      paymentSession.id,
      {}
    )
} catch (e) {
  // retrieve the payment session again
  const updatedPaymentSession = (
    await paymentModuleService.listPaymentSessions({
      id: [paymentSession.id],
    })
  )[0]

  if (updatedPaymentSession.status === "requires_more") {
    // TODO perform required action
    // TODO authorize payment again.
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Payment Flow Complete

The payment flow is complete once the payment session is authorized and the payment is created.

You can then use the payment to capture the amount using the [capturePayment method](/references/payment/capturePayment). You can also refund captured amounts using the [refundPayment method](/references/payment/refundPayment).

<Note>

Some payment providers allow capturing the payment automatically once it’s authorized. In that case, you don’t need to do it manually.
