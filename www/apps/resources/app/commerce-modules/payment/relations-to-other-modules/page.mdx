This document showcases the link modules defined between the Payment Module and other commerce modules.

## Cart Module

The Payment Module can be used with the Cart Module to accept payment for the cart during checkout.

Learn more about this relation in [this documentation](../payment-collection/page.mdx#usage-with-the-cart-module).

## Payment Module

An order's payment is stored in a payment collection. Medusa defines a link module that builds a relationship between the `Order` and `PaymentCollection` data models.

## Region Module

You can specify for each region which payment providers are available. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `PaymentProvider` and the `Region` data models.

This increases the flexibility of your store.

For example, paired with other modules, such as the Cart Module, you only show during checkout the payment providers associated with the cart's region.
