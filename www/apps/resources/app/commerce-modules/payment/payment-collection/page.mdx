In this document, you’ll learn what a payment collection is and how to use it with the Cart Module.

## What's a Payment Collection?

A payment collection stores payment details related to a resource, such as a cart or an order. It’s represented by the [PaymentCollection data model](/references/payment/models/PaymentCollection).

Every purchase or request for payment starts with a payment collection. The collection holds details necessary to complete the payment, including:

- The payment sessions that represents the payment amount to authorize.
- The payments that are created when a payment session is authorized. They can be captured and refunded.
- The payment providers that handle the processing of each payment session, including the authorization, capture, and refund.

## Multiple Payments

The payment collection supports multiple payment sessions and payments. You can use this to accept payments in increments or split payments across payment providers.

## Usage with the Cart Module

The Cart Module provides cart management features. However, it doesn’t provide any features related to accepting payment.

With the Payment Module, you can create a payment collection for the cart and process the payment.

The Medusa application creates a link between the `PaymentCollection` and `Cart` data models. It also implements the payment flow during checkout as explained in [this documentation](../payment-flow/page.mdx).
