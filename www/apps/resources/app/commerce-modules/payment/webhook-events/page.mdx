In this document, you’ll learn how the Payment Module supports listening to webhook events.

## What's a Webhook Event?

A webhook event is sent from a third-party payment provider to your application. It indicates a change in a payment’s status. This is useful in different cases such as when a payment is being processed asynchronously or when a request is interrupted.

## processEvent Method

The Payment Module’s main service (`IPaymentModuleService`) provides a [processEvent method](/references/payment/processEvent) used to handle incoming webhook events from third-party payment services. The method delegates the handling to the associated payment provider, which returns the event's details.

Medusa implements a webhook listener at the `/hooks/payment/[provider]` API route, where `[provider]` is the ID of the provider (for example, `stripe`). You can use that webhook listener in your third-party payment provider's configurations.

If the event's details indicate that the payment should be authorized, then the [authorizePaymentSession method of the main service](/references/payment/authorizePaymentSession) is executed on the specified payment session.

If the event's details indicate that the payment should be captured, then the [capturePayment method of the main service](/references/payment/capturePayment) is executed on the payment of the specified payment session.
