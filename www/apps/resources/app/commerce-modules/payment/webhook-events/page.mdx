In this document, you’ll learn how the Payment Module supports listening to webhook events.

## What's a Webhook Event?

A webhook event is sent from a third-party payment provider to your application. It indicates a change in a payment’s status.

This is useful in many cases such as when a payment is being processed asynchronously or when a request is interrupted and the payment provider is sending details on the process later.

## getWebhookActionAndData Method

The Payment Module’s main service has a [getWebhookActionAndData method](/references/payment/getWebhookActionAndData) used to handle incoming webhook events from third-party payment services. The method delegates the handling to the associated payment provider, which returns the event's details.

Medusa implements a webhook listener route at the `/hooks/payment/[provider]` API route, where `[provider]` is the ID of the provider (for example, `stripe`). Use that webhook listener in your third-party payment provider's configurations.

If the event's details indicate that the payment should be authorized, then the [authorizePaymentSession method of the main service](/references/payment/authorizePaymentSession) is executed on the specified payment session.

If the event's details indicate that the payment should be captured, then the [capturePayment method of the main service](/references/payment/capturePayment) is executed on the payment of the specified payment session.

### Actions After Webhook Payment Processing

After the payment webhook actions are processed and the payment is authorized or captured, the Medusa application completes the cart associated with the payment's collection if it's not completed yet.
