In this document, you’ll learn how about the different types of API keys, and their expiration and verification.
## API Key Types

There are two types of API keys:

- `publishable`: A public key used in client applications, such as a storefront.
- `secret`: A secret key used for authentication and verification purposes, such as an admin user’s authentication token or a password reset token.

The API key’s type is stored in the `type` field of the [ApiKey data model](/references/api-key/models/ApiKey).

---

## API Key Expiration

An API key expires when it’s revoked using the [revoke method of the module’s main service](/references/api-key/revoke).

The associated token is no longer usable or verifiable.

---

## Token Verification

To verify a token received as an input or in a request, use the [authenticate method of the module’s main service](/references/api-key/authenticate) which validates the token against all non-expired tokens.
