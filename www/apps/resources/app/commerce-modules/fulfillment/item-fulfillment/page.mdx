In this document, you’ll learn about the concepts of item fulfillment.

## Fulfillment Data Model

A fulfillment is the shipping and delivery of one or more items to the customer. It’s represented by the [Fulfillment data model](/references/fulfillment/models/Fulfillment).

---

## Fulfillment Processing

A fulfillment is associated with a fulfillment provider that handles all its processing, such as creating a shipment for the fulfillment’s items.

The fulfillment is also associated with a shipping option of that provider, which determines how the item is shipped.

## data Field

The `Fulfillment` data model has a `data` field that holds any necessary data for the third-party fulfillment provider to process the fulfillment.

For example, the `data` field can hold the ID of the fulfillment in the third-party provider. The associated fulfillment provider then uses it whenever it retrieves the fulfillment’s details.

## Fulfillment Items

A fulfillment is used to fulfill one or more items. Each item is represented by the `FulfillmentItem` data model.

The fulfillment item holds details relevant to fulfilling the item, such as barcode, SKU, and quantity to fulfill.

## Fulfillment Label

Once a shipment is created for the fulfillment, you can store its tracking number, URL, or other related details as a label, represented by the `FulfillmentLabel` data model.

---

## Fulfillment Status

The `Fulfillment` data model has three fields to keep track of the current status of the fulfillment:

- `packed_at`: The date the fulfillment was packed. If set, then the fulfillment has been packed.
- `shipped_at`: The date the fulfillment was shipped. If set, then the fulfillment has been shipped.
- `delivered_at`: The date the fulfillment was delivered. If set, then the fulfillment has been delivered.
