In this chapter, you’ll learn about architectural modules.

## What is an Architectural Module?

An architectural module implements features and mechanisms related to the Medusa application’s architecture and infrastructure.

Since modules are interchangeable, you have more control over Medusa’s architecture. For example, you can choose to use Memcached for event handling instead of Redis.

<Note>

Refer to the [Architectural Modules reference](!resources!/architectural-modules) for a list of Medusa’s architectural modules.

## How to Create an Architectural Module?

You create an architectural module like you’ve been creating custom modules: create a module with a service and export that service in the module’s definition file. The module's service extends an abstract class or interface provided by Medusa with predefined method signatures. 

The next chapters explain the different architectural module types and how to create an architectural module for each.
