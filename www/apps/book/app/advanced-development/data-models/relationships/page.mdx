In this chapter, you’ll learn how to define relationships between data models in your module.

## What is a Relationship Property?

A relationship property is defined using relation methods, such as `hasOne` or `belongsTo`. It represents a relationship between two data models in a module. 

---

## One-to-One Relationship

To define a one-to-one relationship, create relationship properties in the data models using the following methods:

1. `hasOne`: indicates that the model has one record of the specified model.
2. `belongsTo`: indicates that the model belongs to one record of the specified model.

For example:

export const oneToOneHighlights = [
  ["5", "hasOne", "A user has one email."],
  ["10", "belongsTo", "An email belongs to a user."],
  ["11", `"email"`, "The relationship's name in the `User` data model."]
]

```ts highlights={oneToOneHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const User = model.define("user", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  email: model.hasOne(() => Email),
})

const Email = model.define("email", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  user: model.belongsTo(() => User, {
    mappedBy: "email",
  }),
})
```

The `hasOne` and `belongsTo` methods accept a function as a first parameter. The function returns the associated data model.

The `belongsTo` method also requires passing as a second parameter an object with the property `mappedBy`. Its value is the name of the relationship property in the other data model.

In the example above, a user has one email, and an email belongs to one user.

## One-to-Many Relationship

To define a one-to-many relationship, create relationship properties in the data models using the following methods:

1. `hasMany`: indicates that the model has more than one records of the specified model.
2. `belongsTo`: indicates that the model belongs to one record of the specified model.

For example:

export const oneToManyHighlights = [
  ["5", "hasMany", "A store has many products"],
  ["10", "belongsTo", "A product has one store."],
  ["11", `"products"`, "The relationship's name in the `Store` data model."]
]

```ts highlights={oneToManyHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const Store = model.define("store", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  products: model.hasMany(() => Product),
})

const Product = model.define("product", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  store: model.belongsTo(() => Store, {
    mappedBy: "products",
  }),
})
```

In this example, a store has many products, but a product belongs to one store.

---

## Many-to-Many Relationship

To define a many-to-many relationship, create relationship properties in the data models using the `manyToMany` method.

For example:

export const manyToManyHighlights = [
  ["5", "manyToMany", "An order is associated with many products."],
  ["10", "manyToMany", "A product is associated with many orders."]
]

```ts highlights={manyToManyHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const Order = model.define("order", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  products: model.manyToMany(() => Product),
})

const Product = model.define("product", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  order: model.manyToMany(() => Order),
})
```

In this example, an order is associated with many products, and a product is associated with many orders.

---

## Configure Relationship Property Name

The relationship property methods accept as a second parameter an object of options. The `mappedBy` property defines the name of the relationship in the other data model.

As seen in previous examples, the `mappedBy` option is required for the `belongsTo` method.

For example:

export const relationNameHighlights = [
  ["6", `"owner"`, "The relationship's name in the `Email` data model."],
  ["13", `"email"`, "The relationship's name in the `User` data model."]
]

```ts highlights={relationNameHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const User = model.define("user", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  email: model.hasOne(() => Email, {
    mappedBy: "owner",
  }),
})

const Email = model.define("email", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  owner: model.belongsTo(() => User, {
    mappedBy: "email",
  }),
})
```

In this example, you specify in the `User` data model’s relationship property that the name of the relationship in the `Email` data model is `owner`.

This is useful if the relationship property’s name is different than that of the associated data model.

---

## Cascades

When an operation is performed on a data model, such as record deletion, the relationship cascade specifies what related data model records should be affected by it.

For example, if a store is deleted, its products should also be deleted.

The `cascades` method used on a data model configures which child records an operation is cascaded to.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["8", "", "When a store is deleted, delete its associated products."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const Store = model.define("store", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  products: model.hasMany(() => Product),
})
.cascades({
  delete: ["products"],
})

const Product = model.define("product", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  store: model.belongsTo(() => Store, {
    mappedBy: "products",
  }),
})
```

The `cascades` method accepts an object. Its key is the operation’s name, such as `delete`. The value is an array of relationship property names that the operation is cascaded to.

In the example above, when a store is deleted, its associated products are also deleted.
