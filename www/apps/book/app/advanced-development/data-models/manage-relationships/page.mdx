In this chapter, you'll learn how to manage relationships between data models when creating or updating their records using the module's main service.

<Note type="soon" title="Important">

Data model relationships are in active development and may change.

</Note>

## Manage One-to-One and One-to-Many Relationship

When you create a record of a data model that belongs to another, pass the ID of the other data model's record in the `{relation_name}_id` property.

For example, assuming you have the [User and Email data models from the previous chapter](../relationships/page.mdx#one-to-one-relationship):

export const belongsHighlights = [
  ["4", "user_id", "The ID of the user the email belongs to."],
  ["11", "user_id", "The ID of the user the email belongs to."]
]

```ts highlights={belongsHighlights}
// when creating an email
const email = await helloModuleService.createEmail({
  // other properties...
  user_id: "123",
})

// when updating an email
const email = await helloModuleService.updateEmail({
  id: "321",
  // other properties...
  user_id: "123",
})
```

In the example above, you pass the `user_id` property when creating or updating an email to specify the user it belongs to.

## Manage Many-to-Many Relationship

When you create or update a record of a data model that has a many-to-many relationship to another data model, pass an array of IDs of the other data model's records in the `{relation_name}_ids` property.

For example, assuming you have the [Order and Product data models from the previous chapter](../relationships/page.mdx#many-to-many-relationship):

export const manyHighlights = [
  ["4", "order_ids", "The IDs of the orders associated with the product."],
  ["11", "product_ids", "The IDs of the products associated with the order."]
]

```ts highlights={manyHighlights}
// when creating a product
const product = await helloModuleService.createProduct({
  // other properties...
  order_ids: ["123", "321"],
})

// when updating an order
const order = await helloModuleService.updateOrder({
  id: "321",
  // other properties...
  product_ids: ["123", "321"],
})
```

In the example above, you pass the `order_ids` property when you create (or update) a product, and you pass the `product_ids` property when you update (or create) an order.
