In this chapter, you'll learn how subscribers receive an event's data payload.

## Access Event's Data Payload

When events are emitted, they’re emitted with a data payload. 

The object that the subscriber function receives as a parameter has a `data` property, which is the event's data payload.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["7", "", "The event's data payload."],
  ["8", "{ id: string }", "The type of expected data payloads."],
  ["9", '"data" in data ? data.data.id : data.id', "The payload data is either in `data.data` or directly in `data`."]
]

```ts title="src/subscribers/product-created.ts" highlights={highlights} collapsibleLines="1-5" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import type {
  SubscriberArgs,
  SubscriberConfig,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

export default async function productCreateHandler({
  data,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const productId = "data" in data ? data.data.id : data.id
  console.log(`The product ${productId} was created`)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "product.created",
}
```

This logs the product ID received in the `product.created` event’s data payload to the console.
