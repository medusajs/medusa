In this chapter, you’ll learn how to set a timeout for workflows and steps.

## What is a Workflow Timeout?

By default, a workflow doesn’t have a timeout. It continues execution until it’s finished or an error occurs.

You can configure a workflow’s timeout to indicate how long the workflow can execute. If a workflow's execution time passes the configured timeout, it is failed and an error is thrown.

### Timeout Doesn't Stop Step Execution

Configuring a timeout doesn't stop the execution of a step in progress. The timeout only affects the status of the workflow and its result.

## Configure Workflow Timeout

The `createWorkflow` function can accept a configuration object instead of the workflow’s name.

In the configuration object, you pass a `timeout` property, whose value is a number indicating the timeout in seconds.

For example:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={[["16"]]} collapsibleLines="1-13" expandButtonLabel="Show More"
import { 
  createStep,  
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1",
  async () => {
    // ...
  }
)

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  name: "hello-world",
  timeout: 2, // 2 seconds
}, function () {
  const str1 = step1()

  return new WorkflowResponse({
    message: str1,
  })
})

export default myWorkflow

```

This workflow's executions fail if they run longer than two seconds.

<Note title="Tip">

A workflow’s timeout error is returned in the `errors` property of the workflow’s execution, as explained in [this chapter](../access-workflow-errors/page.mdx). The error’s name is `TransactionTimeoutError`.

</Note>

## Configure Step Timeout

Alternatively, you can configure the timeout for a step rather than the entire workflow.

<Note>

As mentioned in the previous section, the timeout doesn't stop the execution of the step. It only affects the step's status and output.

</Note>

The step’s configuration object accepts a `timeout` property, whose value is a number indicating the timeout in seconds.

For example:

```tsx
const step1 = createStep(
  {
    name: "step-1",
    timeout: 2, // 2 seconds
  },
  async () => {
    // ...
  }
)
```

This step's executions fail if they run longer than two seconds.

<Note title="Tip">

A step’s timeout error is returned in the `errors` property of the workflow’s execution, as explained in [this chapter](../access-workflow-errors/page.mdx). The error’s name is `TransactionStepTimeoutError`.
