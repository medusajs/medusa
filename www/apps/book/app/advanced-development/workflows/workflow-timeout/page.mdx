In this chapter, you’ll learn how to set a timeout for workflows and steps.

## Configure Workflow Timeout

By default, a workflow doesn’t have a timeout. It continues execution until it’s finished or an error occurs.

You can configure a workflow’s timeout to indicate how long the workflow can run. Once the specified time is passed and the workflow is still running, the workflow is considered failed and an error is thrown.

<Note>

Timeout doesn't stop the execution of a running step. The timeout only affects the status of the workflow and its result.

</Note>

For example:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={[["22"]]} collapsibleLines="1-16" expandButtonLabel="Show More"
import { 
  createStep,  
  createWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1",
  async () => {
    // ...
  }
)

type WorkflowOutput = {
  message: string
}

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow<
  {},
  WorkflowOutput
>({
  name: "hello-world",
  timeout: 2, // 2 seconds
}, function () {
  const str1 = step1()

  return {
    message: str1,
  }
})

export default myWorkflow

```

The `createWorkflow` function can accept a configuration object instead of the workflow’s name. In the configuration object, you pass a `timeout` property, whose value is a number indicating the timeout in seconds.

<Note title="Tip">

A workflow’s timeout error is returned in the `errors` property of the workflow’s execution, as explained in [this chapter](../access-workflow-errors/page.mdx). The error’s name is `TransactionTimeoutError`.

</Note>

## Configure Step Timeout

Alternatively, you can configure timeout for a step rather than the entire workflow.

<Note>

As mentioned in the previous section, the timeout doesn't stop the execution of the step. It only affects the step's status and output.

</Note>

For example:

```tsx
const step1 = createStep(
  {
    name: "step-1",
    timeout: 2, // 2 seconds
  },
  async () => {
    // ...
  }
)
```

The step’s configuration object accepts a `timeout` property, whose value is a number indicating the timeout in seconds.

<Note title="Tip">

A step’s timeout error is returned in the `errors` property of the workflow’s execution, as explained in [this chapter](../access-workflow-errors/page.mdx). The error’s name is `TransactionStepTimeoutError`.
