In this chapter, you'll learn what a compensation function is and how to add it to a step.

## What is a Compensation Function

A compensation function rolls back or undoes changes made by a step when an error occurs in the workflow.

For example, if a step creates a record, the compensation function deletes the record when an error occurs later in the workflow.

By using compensation functions, you provide a mechanism that guarantees data consistency in your application and across systems.

## How to add a Compensation Function?

A compensation function is passed as a second parameter to the `createStep` function.

For example, create the file `src/workflows/hello-world.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={[["15"], ["16"], ["17"]]} collapsibleLines="1-5" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1",
  async () => {
    const message = `Hello from step one!`

    console.log(message)

    return new StepResponse(message)
  },
  async () => {
    console.log("Oops! Rolling back my changes...")
  }
)
```

Each step can have a compensation function. The compensation function only runs if an error occurs throughout the workflow.

---

## Test the Compensation Function

Create a step in the same `src/workflows/hello-world.ts` file that throws an error:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts"
const step2 = createStep(
  "step-2",
  async () => {
    throw new Error("Throwing an error...")
  }
)
```

Then, create a workflow that uses the steps:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" collapsibleLines="1-8" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
// other imports...

// steps...

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function (input) {
  const str1 = step1()
  step2()

  return new WorkflowResponse({
    message: str1,
  })
})

export default myWorkflow
```

Finally, execute the workflow from an API route:

```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts" collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import myWorkflow from "../../../workflows/hello-world"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { result } = await myWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run()

  res.send(result)
}
```

Run the Medusa application and send a `GET` request to `/workflow`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/workflow
```

In the console, you'll see:

- `Hello from step one!` logged in the terminal, indicating that the first step ran successfully.
- `Oops! Rolling back my changes...` logged in the terminal, indicating that the second step failed and the compensation function of the first step ran consequently.

## Pass Input to Compensation Function

If a step creates a record, the compensation function must receive the ID of the record to remove it.

To pass input to the compensation function, pass a second parameter in the `StepResponse` returned by the step.

For example:

export const inputHighlights = [
  ["11", "", "The data to pass as an input to the compensation function."],
  ["14", "{ message }", "The data received as an input from `StepResponse`'s second parameter."]
]

```ts highlights={inputHighlights}
import { 
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1",
  async () => {
    return new StepResponse(
      `Hello from step one!`, 
      { message: "Oops! Rolling back my changes..." }
    )
  },
  async ({ message }) => {
    console.log(message)
  }
)
```

In this example, the step passes an object as a second parameter to `StepResponse`.

The compensation function receives the object and uses its `message` property to log a message.

---

## Resolve Resources from the Medusa Container

The compensation function receives an object second parameter. The object has a `container` property that you use to resolve resources from the Medusa container.

For example:

export const containerHighlights = [
  ["15", "container", "Access the container in the second parameter object."],
  ["16", "resolve", "Use the container to resolve resources."]
]

```ts
import { 
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { ContainerRegistrationKeys } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1",
  async () => {
    return new StepResponse(
      `Hello from step one!`, 
      { message: "Oops! Rolling back my changes..." }
    )
  },
  async ({ message }, { container }) => {
    const logger = container.resolve(
      ContainerRegistrationKeys.LOGGER
    )

    logger.info(message)
  }
)
```

In this example, you use the `container` property in the second object parameter of the compensation function to resolve the logger.

You then use the logger to log a message.
