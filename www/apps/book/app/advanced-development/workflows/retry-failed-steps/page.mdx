In this chapter, you’ll learn how to configure steps to allow retrial on failure.

## Configure a Step’s Retrial

By default, when an error occurs in a step, the step and the workflow fail, and the execution stops.

You can configure the step to retry on failure. The `createStep` function can accept a configuration object instead of the step’s name as a first parameter.

For example:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={[["9"]]} collapsibleLines="1-5" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  createStep, 
  createWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  {
    name: "step-1",
    maxRetries: 2,
  },
  async () => {
    console.log("Executing step 1")

    throw new Error("Oops! Something happened.")
  }
)

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function () {
  const str1 = step1()

  return {
    message: str1,
  }
})

export default myWorkflow
```

The step’s configuration object accepts a `maxRetries` property, which is a number indicating the number of times a step can be retried when it fails.

When you execute the above workflow, you’ll see the following result in the terminal:

```bash
Executing step 1
Executing step 1
Executing step 1
error:   Oops! Something happened.
Error: Oops! Something happened.
```

The first line indicates the first time the step was executed, and the next two lines indicate the times the step was retried. After that, the step and workflow fail.

## Step Retry Intervals

By default, a step is retried immediately after it fails.

To specify a wait time before a step is retried, pass a `retryInterval` property to the step's configuration object. Its value is a number of seconds to wait before retrying the step.

For example:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={[["5"]]}
const step1 = createStep(
  {
    name: "step-1",
    maxRetries: 2,
    retryInterval: 2, // 2 seconds
  },
  async () => {
    // ...
  }
)
```
