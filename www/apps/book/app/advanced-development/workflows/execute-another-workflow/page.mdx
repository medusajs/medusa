In this chapter, you'll learn how to execute a workflow in another.

## Execute in a Step

Workflows are executed in a step similar to how you execute them in any other resource. However, you must pass the step's context to the workflow.

For example:

export const stepHighlights = [
  ["10", "context", "A step function accepts a context object in the properties of its second parameter."],
  ["19", "context", "Pass the context of the step."]
]

```ts highlights={stepHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-7" expandMoreButton="Show Imports"
import {
  createStep
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { 
  createProductsWorkflow
} from "@medusajs/core-flows"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1",
  async (input, { container, context }) => {
    const products = await createProductsWorkflow(container)
      .run({
        input: {
          products: [
            // ...
          ]
        },
        context
      })

    // ...
  }
)
```

A step function receives a `context` property in its second parameter. This object contains the execution details of the workflow the step is part of.

When running another workflow in the step, pass the context in the object parameter of the `run` method.

## Execute in a Workflow

To execute another workflow in a workflow, use the `runAsStep` method that every workflow has.

For example:

export const workflowsHighlights = [
  ["11", "runAsStep", "Use the `runAsStep` method to run the workflow as a step."],
  ["12", "input", "Pass the input as you did in the `run` method before."]
]

```ts highlights={workflowsHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-7" expandMoreButton="Show Imports"
import {
  createWorkflow
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { 
  createProductsWorkflow
} from "@medusajs/core-flows"

const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world",
  async (input) => {
    const products = await createProductsWorkflow.runAsStep({
      input: {
        products: [
          // ...
        ]
      },
    })

    // ...
  }
)
```

Instead of invoking the workflow, passing it the container, you instead use its `runAsStep` method and pass it an object as a parameter. The object has an `input` property to pass input to the workflow.
