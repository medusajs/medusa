In this chapter, you'll learn how to execute a workflow in another.

## Execute in a Workflow

To execute a workflow in another, use the `runAsStep` method that every workflow has.

For example:

export const workflowsHighlights = [
  ["11", "runAsStep", "Use the `runAsStep` method to run the workflow as a step."],
  ["12", "input", "Pass the input as you did in the `run` method before."]
]

```ts highlights={workflowsHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-7" expandMoreButton="Show Imports"
import {
  createWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { 
  createProductsWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/core-flows"

const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world",
  async (input) => {
    const products = createProductsWorkflow.runAsStep({
      input: {
        products: [
          // ...
        ],
      },
    })

    // ...
  }
)
```

Instead of invoking the workflow, passing it the container, you instead use its `runAsStep` method and pass it an object as a parameter. The object has an `input` property to pass input to the workflow.

## Preparing Input Data

If you need to perform some data manipulation to prepare the other workflow's input data, use the `transform` utility function imported from `@medusajs/workflows-sdk`.

For example:

export const transformHighlights = [
  ["16", "transform", "Make changes to the input data before passing it to the workflow."],
  ["26", "createProductsData", "Pass the data prepared with the `transform` function to the workflow."]
]

```ts highlights={transformHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-12"
import {
  createWorkflow,
  transform,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { 
  createProductsWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/core-flows"

type WorkflowInput = {
  title: string
}

const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-product",
  async (input: WorkflowInput) => {
    const createProductsData = transform({
      input,
    }, (data) => [
      {
        title: `Hello ${data.input.title}`,
      },
    ])

    const products = createProductsWorkflow.runAsStep({
      input: {
        products: createProductsData,
      },
    })

    // ...
  }
)
```

In this example, you use the `transform` function to prepend `Hello` to the title of the product. Then, you pass the variable created through `transform` as an input to the `createProductsWorkflow`.

---

## Run Workflow Conditionally

To run a workflow in another based on a condition, use the `when` utility function imported from `@medusajs/workflows-sdk`.

For example:

export const whenHighlights = [
  ["20", "when", "If `should_create` passed in the input is enabled, then run the function passed to `then`."],
  ["22", "createProductsWorkflow", "Workflow only runs if `when`'s condition is `true`."]
]

```ts collapsibleLines="1-16"
import {
  createWorkflow,
  when,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { 
  createProductsWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/core-flows"
import { 
  CreateProductWorkflowInputDTO,
} from "@medusajs/types"

type WorkflowInput = {
  product?: CreateProductWorkflowInputDTO
  should_create?: boolean
}

const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-product",
  async (input: WorkflowInput) => {
    const product = when(input, ({ should_create }) => should_create)
      .then(() => {
        return createProductsWorkflow.runAsStep({
          input: {
            products: [input.product],
          },
        })
      })
  }
)
```

In this example, you use the `when` utility to run the `createProductsWorkflow` only if `should_create` (passed in the `input`) is enabled.
