In this chapter, you'll learn what a workflow hook is and how to consume them.

## What is a Workflow Hook?

A workflow hook is a point in a workflow where you can inject custom functionality as a step function, called a hook handler.

Medusa exposes hooks in many of its workflows that are used in its API routes. You can consume those hooks to add your custom logic.

<Note title="Tip">

Refer to the [Workflows Reference](!resources!/medusa-workflows-reference) to view all workflows and their hooks.

You want to perform a custom action during a workflow's execution, such as when a product is created.

## How to Consume a Hook?

A workflow has a special `hooks` property which is an object that holds its hooks.

So, in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created under the `src/workflows/hooks` directory:

- Import the workflow.
- Access its hook using the `hooks` property.
- Pass the hook a step function as a parameter to consume it.

For example, to consume the `productsCreated` hook of Medusa's `createProductsWorkflow`, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/product-created.ts` with the following content:

export const handlerHighlights = [
  ["3", "productsCreated", "Invoke the hook, passing it a step function as a parameter."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/product-created.ts" highlights={handlerHighlights}
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  async ({ products }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  }
)
```

The `productsCreated` hook is available on the workflow's `hooks` property by its name.

You invoke the hook, passing a step function (the hook handler) as a parameter.

Now, when a product is created using the [Create Product API route](!api!/admin#products_postproducts), your hook handler is executed after the product is created.

<Note>

A hook can have only one handler.

</Note>

<Note title="Tip">

Refer to the [createProductsWorkflow reference](!resources!/references/medusa-workflows/createProductsWorkflow) to see at which point the hook handler is executed.

</Note>

### Hook Handler Parameter

Since a hook handler is essentially a step function, it receives the hook's input as a first parameter, and an object holding a `container` property as a second parameter.

Each hook has different input. For example, the `productsCreated` hook receives an object having a `products` property holding the created product.

### Hook Handler Compensation

Since the hook handler is a step function, you can set its compensation function as a second parameter of the hook.

For example:

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/product-created.ts"
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

createProductsWorkflow.productCreated(
  async ({ productId }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action

    return new StepResponse(undefined, { ids })
  },
  async ({ ids }, { container }) => {
    // undo the performed action
  }
)
```

The compensation function is executed if an error occurs in the workflow to undo the actions performed by the hook handler.

The compensation function receives as an input the second parameter passed to the `StepResponse` returned by the step function.

It also accepts as a second parameter an object holding a `container` property to resolve resources from the Medusa container.

### Additional Data Property

Medusa's workflows pass in the hook's input an `additional_data` property:

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/product-created.ts" highlights={[["4", "additional_data"]]}
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  async ({ products, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  }
)
```

This property is an object that holds additional data passed to the workflow through the request sent to the API route using the workflow.

<Note>

Learn how to pass `additional_data` in requests to API routes in [this chapter](../../api-routes/additional-data/page.mdx).

</Note>

### Pass Additional Data to Workflow

You can also pass that additional data when executing the workflow. Pass it as a parameter to the `.run` method of the workflow:

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/product-created.ts" highlights={[["10", "additional_data"]]}
import type { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

export async function POST(req: MedusaRequest, res: MedusaResponse) {
  await createProductsWorkflow(req.scope).run({
    input: { 
      products: [
        // ...
      ], 
      additional_data: {
        custom_field: "test",
      },
    },
  })
}
```

Your hook handler then receives that passed data in the `additional_data` object.
