In this chapter, you’ll learn more about widgets and how to use them.

## What is an Admin Widget?

Admin widgets are React components you inject into predetermined injection zones in the Medusa Admin dashboard.

For example, you can add a widget on the order details page that shows payment details retrieved from Stripe.

## How to Create a Widget?

A widget is created in a file under the `src/admin/widgets` directory. The file’s default export must be the widget, which is the React component. The file must also export the widget’s configurations.

For example, create the file `src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx` with the following content:

export const widgetHighlights = [
  ["5", "ProductWidget", "The React component of the product widget."], 
  ["15", "zone", "The zone to inject the widget to."]
]

```tsx title="src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx" highlights={widgetHighlights}
import { defineWidgetConfig } from "@medusajs/admin-shared"
import { Container, Heading } from "@medusajs/ui"

// The widget
const ProductWidget = () => {
  return (
    <Container>
      <Heading level="h2">Product Widget</Heading>
    </Container>
  )
}

// The widget's configurations
export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})

export default ProductWidget
```

The widget only shows the heading `Product Widget`.

Use the `defineWidgetConfig` function imported from `@medusajs/admin-shared` to create and export the widget's configurations. It accepts as a parameter an object with the following property:

- `zone`: A string or an array of strings, each being the name of the zone to inject the widget into.

In the example above, the widget is injected at the top of a product’s details.

---

## Test the Widget

To test out the widget, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, open a product’s details page. You’ll find your custom widget at the top of the page.

---

## Detail Widget Props

Widgets that are injected into a details page (for example, `product.details.before`) receive a `data` prop, which is the main data of the details page (for example, the product object).

For example:

export const detailHighlights = [
  ["10", "data", "Receive the data as a prop."],
  ["11", "AdminProduct", "Pass the expected type of `data` as a type argument."],
  ["15", "data.title"]
]

```tsx title="src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx" highlights={detailHighlights}
import { defineWidgetConfig } from "@medusajs/admin-shared"
import { Container, Heading } from "@medusajs/ui"
import { 
  DetailWidgetProps, 
  AdminProduct,
} from "@medusajs/types"

// The widget
const ProductWidget = ({ 
  data,
}: DetailWidgetProps<AdminProduct>) => {
  return (
    <Container>
      <Heading level="h2">
        Product Widget {data.title}
      </Heading>
    </Container>
  )
}

// The widget's configurations
export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})

export default ProductWidget
```

Notice that the type of the props is `DetailWidgetProps`, which accepts as a type argument the expected type of `data`.
