In this chapter, you’ll learn about middlewares and how to create them.

## What is a Middleware?

A middleware is a function executed when a request is sent to an API Route. It's executed before the route handler function.

---

## How to Create a Middleware?

Middlewares are defined in the special file `src/api/middlewares.ts`. Use the `defineMiddlewares` function imported from `@medusajs/medusa` to define the middlewares, and export its value.

For example:

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts"
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import type { 
  MedusaNextFunction, 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse, 
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/store*",
      middlewares: [
        (
          req: MedusaRequest, 
          res: MedusaResponse, 
          next: MedusaNextFunction
        ) => {
          console.log("Received a request!")

          next()
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

The `defineMiddlewares` function accepts a middleware configurations object that has the property `routes`. `routes`'s value is an array of middleware route objects, each having the following properties:

- `matcher`: a string or regular expression indicating the API route path to apply the middleware on.
- `middlewares`: An array of middleware functions.

In the example above, you define a middleware that logs the message `Received a request!` whenever a request is sent to an API route path starting with `/store`.

---

## Test the Middleware

To test the middleware:

1. Start the application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

2. Send a request to any API route starting with `/store`.
3. See the following message in the terminal:

```bash
Received a request!
```

## When to Use Middlewares

<Note type="success" title="Use middlewares when">

- You want to protect API routes by a custom condition.
- You're modifying the request body.

</Note>

---

## Middleware Function Parameters

The middleware function accepts three parameters:

1. A request object of type `MedusaRequest`.
2. A response object of type `MedusaResponse`.
3. A function of type `MedusaNextFunction` that executes the next middleware in the stack.

<Note title="Important">

You must call the `next` function in the middleware. Otherwise, other middlewares and the API route handler won’t execute.

</Note>

---

## Restrict HTTP Methods

In addition to the `matcher` configuration, you can restrict which HTTP methods the middleware is applied to.

For example:

export const highlights = [["12", "method", "Apply the middleware only on `POST` requests"]]

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts" highlights={highlights} collapsibleLines="1-7" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import type { 
  MedusaNextFunction, 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse, 
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/store*",
      method: ["POST", "PUT"],
      middlewares: [
        (
          req: MedusaRequest, 
          res: MedusaResponse, 
          next: MedusaNextFunction
        ) => {
          console.log("Received a request!")

          next()
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

The object in the `routes` array accepts the property `method` whose value is one or more HTTP methods to apply the middleware to.

This applies the middleware only when a `POST` or `PUT` request is sent to an API route path starting with `/store`.
