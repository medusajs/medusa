In this chapter, you’ll learn about middlewares and how to create them.

## What is a Middleware?

A middleware is a function executed when a request is sent to an API Route. It's executed before the route handler function.

Middlwares are used to guard API routes, parse request content types other than `application/json`, manipulate request data, and more.

<Note title="Tip">

As Medusa's server is based on Express, you can use any [Express middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html).

## How to Create a Middleware?

Middlewares are defined in the special file `src/api/middlewares.ts`. Use the `defineMiddlewares` function imported from `@medusajs/medusa` to define the middlewares, and export its value.

For example:

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts"
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import type { 
  MedusaNextFunction, 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse, 
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/custom*",
      middlewares: [
        (
          req: MedusaRequest, 
          res: MedusaResponse, 
          next: MedusaNextFunction
        ) => {
          console.log("Received a request!")

          next()
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

The `defineMiddlewares` function accepts a middleware configurations object that has the property `routes`. `routes`'s value is an array of middleware route objects, each having the following properties:

- `matcher`: a string or regular expression indicating the API route path to apply the middleware on. The regular expression must be compatible with [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp).
- `middlewares`: An array of middleware functions.

In the example above, you define a middleware that logs the message `Received a request!` whenever a request is sent to an API route path starting with `/custom`.

---

## Test the Middleware

To test the middleware:

1. Start the application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

2. Send a request to any API route starting with `/custom`.
3. See the following message in the terminal:

```bash
Received a request!
```

## When to Use Middlewares

<Note type="success" title="Use middlewares when">

- You want to protect API routes by a custom condition.
- You're modifying the request body.

</Note>

---

## Middleware Function Parameters

The middleware function accepts three parameters:

1. A request object of type `MedusaRequest`.
2. A response object of type `MedusaResponse`.
3. A function of type `MedusaNextFunction` that executes the next middleware in the stack.

<Note title="Important">

You must call the `next` function in the middleware. Otherwise, other middlewares and the API route handler won’t execute.

</Note>

---

## Middleware for Routes with Path Parameters

To indicate a path parameter in a middleware's `matcher` pattern, use the format `:{param-name}`.

For example:

export const pathParamHighlights = [["11", ":id", "Indicates that the API route accepts an `id` path parameter."]]

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts" collapsibleLines="1-7" expandMoreLabel="Show Imports" highlights={pathParamHighlights}
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import type { 
  MedusaNextFunction, 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse, 
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/custom/:id",
      middlewares: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

This applies a middleware to the routes defined in the file `src/api/custom/[id]/route.ts`.

---

## Restrict HTTP Methods

Restrict which HTTP methods the middleware is applied to using the `method` property of the middleware route object.

For example:

export const highlights = [["12", "method", "Apply the middleware only on `POST` requests"]]

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts" highlights={highlights} collapsibleLines="1-7" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import type { 
  MedusaNextFunction, 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse, 
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/custom*",
      method: ["POST", "PUT"],
      middlewares: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

`method`'s value is one or more HTTP methods to apply the middleware to.

This example applies the middleware only when a `POST` or `PUT` request is sent to an API route path starting with `/custom`.

---

## Request URLs with Trailing Backslashes

A middleware whose `matcher` pattern doesn't end with a backslash won't be applied for requests to URLs with a trailing backslash.

For example, consider you have the following middleware:

```ts collapsibleLines="1-7" expandMoreLabel="Show Imports"
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import type { 
  MedusaNextFunction, 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse, 
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/custom",
      middlewares: [
        (
          req: MedusaRequest, 
          res: MedusaResponse, 
          next: MedusaNextFunction
        ) => {
          console.log("Received a request!")

          next()
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

If you send a request to `http://localhost:9000/custom`, the middleware will run.

However, if you send a request to `http://localhost:9000/custom/`, the middleware won't run.

In general, avoid adding trailing backslashes when sending requests to API routes.
