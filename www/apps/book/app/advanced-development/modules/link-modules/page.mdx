In this chapter, you’ll learn what a link module is.

## What is a Link Module?

A link module is a module whose only purpose is to define a relationship between two modules’ data models. The relationship is represented as a pivot or link table in the database, pointing at the primary keys of each data model.

Link modules are currently only available for Medusa’s commerce modules.

</Note>

For example, Medusa has a link module that defines a relationship between the Product and Pricing modules. It links the `ProductVariant` and `PriceSet` data models.

Link modules create the relationship between modules while maintaining module isolation. The Medusa application only creates the link tables when both modules are available.
