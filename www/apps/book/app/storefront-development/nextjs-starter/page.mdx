## Install Next.js Starter

<Note type="check">

- [Node v18+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- At least one region in the Medusa application.

</Note>

1. Clone the `v2` branch of the [Next.js Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa/tree/v2):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa -b v2 my-medusa-storefront
```

2. Change to the `my-medusa-storefront` directory, install the dependencies, and rename the template environment variable:

```bash npm2yarn
cd my-medusa-storefront
npm install
mv .env.template .env.local
```

3. While the Medusa application is running, start the Next.js storefront:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js Starter Storefront is now running at `localhost:8000`.
