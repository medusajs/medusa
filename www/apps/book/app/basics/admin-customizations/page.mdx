In this chapter, you’ll learn how to customize the Medusa Admin dashboard.

## Overview

The Medusa Admin is an admin dashboard that merchants use to manage their store's data.

You can extend the Medusa Admin to add widgets and new pages. Your customizations interact with API routes to provide merchants with custom functionalities.

The Medusa Admin is installed in your Medusa application and runs at the path `/app` when you start the Medusa application.

## Example: Create a Widget

A widget is a React component that can be injected into an existing page in the admin dashboard.

For example, create the file `src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx title="src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx"
import { defineWidgetConfig } from "@medusajs/admin-shared"

const ProductWidget = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Product Widget</h2>
    </div>
  )
}

export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.after",
})

export default ProductWidget
```

This inserts a widget with the text “Product Widget” at the end of a product’s details page.

### Test the Widget

To test out the widget, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, open a product’s details page. You’ll find your custom widget at the bottom of the page.
