In this chapter, you’ll learn about important directories and files in your Medusa application's project.

## src

This directory is the central place for your custom development. It includes the following sub-directories:

- `admin`: Holds your admin dashboard's custom components and pages.
- `api`: Holds your custom API routes that are added as endpoints in your Medusa application.
- `jobs`: Holds your scheduled jobs that run at a specified interval during your Medusa application's runtime.
- `modules`: Holds your custom modules that implement custom business logic.
- `scripts`: Holds your custom scripts to be executed using Medusa's CLI tool.
- `subscribers`: Holds your event listeners that are executed asynchronously whenever an event is emitted.
- `workflows`: Holds your custom flows that can be executed from anywhere in your application.
