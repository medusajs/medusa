In this chapter, you’ll learn what API Routes are and how to create them.

## What is an API Route?

An API Route is a REST API endpoint. It exposes commerce features to external applications, such as storefronts, the admin dashboard, or third-party systems.

The Medusa core application provides a set of admin and store API routes out-of-the-box. You can also create custom API routes to expose your custom functionalities.

## How to Create an API Route?

An API Route is created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/api` directory of your Medusa application. The file’s name must be `route.ts` or `route.js`. 

Each file exports API Route handler functions for at least one HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc…).

For example, to create a `GET` API Route at `/store/hello-world`, create the file `src/api/store/hello-world/route.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/api/store/hello-world/route.ts"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

export const GET = (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  res.json({
    message: "[GET] Hello world!",
  })
}
```

### Test API Route

To test the API route above, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, send a `GET` request to the `/store/hello-world` API Route:

```bash apiTesting testApiUrl="http://localhost:9000/store/hello-world" testApiMethod="GET"
curl http://localhost:9000/store/hello-world
```
