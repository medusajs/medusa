In this chapter, you’ll learn how to handle events with subscribers.

## What is an Event?

When an action is performed in Medusa, such as creating a product, the Medusa application emits an event. You can listen to those events and perform an asynchronous action.

## What is a Subscriber?

A subscriber is a function executed whenever the event it listens to is emitted.

### How to Create a Subscriber?

A subscriber is created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/subscribers` directory.

For example, create the file `src/subscribers/product-created.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/subscribers/product-created.ts"
import { type SubscriberConfig } from "@medusajs/medusa"

// subscriber function
export default async function productCreateHandler() {
  console.log("A product was created")
}

// subscriber config
export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "product.created",
}
```

A subscriber file must export:

- A subscriber function that is an asynchronous function executed whenever the associated event is triggered.
- A configuration object defining the event this subscriber is listening to.

The above subscriber listens to the `product.created` event. Whenever the event is emitted, it logs in the terminal `A product is created`.

---

## Test the Subscriber

To test the subscriber, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, go to the Medusa Admin at `localhost:9000/app` and create a product. You’ll see the following messages logged in the Medusa application's terminal:

```bash
info:    Processing product.created which has 1 subscribers
A product was created
```

The first message indicates that the `product.created` event was emitted, and the second one is the message logged from the subscriber.

## When to Use Subscribers

<Note title="Use subscribers when" type="success">

- You want to perform an action everytime a specific event is emitted in the Medusa application.

</Note>

---

## Resolve Resources

The subscriber function accepts an object parameter with the property `container`. Its value is the Medusa container, and you can use it to resolve other resources, such as services.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["10", "container", "Recieve the Medusa Container in the object parameter."],
  ["13", "resolve", "Resolve the Product Module's main service."],
  ["13", "ModuleRegistrationName.PRODUCT", "The module's registration name imported from `@medusajs/modules-sdk`."]
]

```ts title="src/subscribers/product-created.ts" highlights={highlights}
import {
  SubscriberArgs,
  type SubscriberConfig,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { IProductModuleService } from "@medusajs/types"
import { ModuleRegistrationName } from "@medusajs/utils"

export default async function productCreateHandler({
  data,
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const productModuleService: IProductModuleService =
    container.resolve(ModuleRegistrationName.PRODUCT)

  const productId = "data" in data ? data.data.id : data.id

  const product = await productModuleService.retrieveProduct(
    productId
  )

  console.log(`The product ${product.title} was created`)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: `product.created`,
}
```

You use the container to resolve the Product Module's main service, then log the title of the created product.
