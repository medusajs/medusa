In this chapter, you’ll learn what data models are and how to create a data model.

## What is a Data Model?

A data model is a class that represents a table in the database. A data model is created in a module. You can then create a service that manages that data model.

Data models are based on [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/quick-start). So, you can use its decorators, types, and utilities when creating a model.

## How to Create a Data Model

<Note title="Steps Summary">

1. Create data model class in a module.
2. Generate migration for the data model.
3. Add migration scripts to the module's definition.
4. Run migration to add table for data model in the database.

</Note>

A data model is a class created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under a module's `models` directory.

For example, create the file `src/modules/hello/models/my-custom.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/models/my-custom.ts"
import { generateEntityId } from "@medusajs/utils"
import { 
  BeforeCreate, 
  Entity, 
  OnInit, 
  PrimaryKey, 
  Property,
} from "@mikro-orm/core"

@Entity()
export class MyCustom {
  @PrimaryKey({ columnType: "text" })
  id!: string

  @Property({ columnType: "text" })
  name: string

  @BeforeCreate()
  onCreate() {
    this.id = generateEntityId(this.id, "mc")
  }

  @OnInit()
  OnInit() {
    this.id = generateEntityId(this.id, "mc")
  }
}
```

This defines a new data model `MyCustom` with the fields `id` and `name`.

The `onCreate` method generates an ID for the data model's record when it's created. The `onInit` method sets the ID when the record is loaded.

<Note title="Tip">

The `generateEntityId` utility method prefixes the `id` of a record with the string provided in the second parameter. This follows Medusa's conventions of creating IDs.

</Note>

### Create a Migration

After creating the data model, you must create a migration that creates a table in your database for this data model.

A migration is a class created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under a module's `migrations` directory. It implements an `up` and `down` method, where the `up` method reflects changes on the database, and the `down` method reverts the changes from the database.

<Details summaryContent="Generate with MikroORM">
  MikroORM provides a CLI tool that helps you generate migrations. To use it:

  1. Create the file `src/modules/hello/mikro-orm.config.dev.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts
  import "dotenv/config"
  import path from "path"
  import { TSMigrationGenerator } from "@medusajs/utils"
  import { MyCustom } from "./models/my-custom"

  module.exports = {
    entities: [MyCustom],
    schema: "public",
    clientUrl: "postgres://postgres@localhost/medusa-hello",
    type: "postgresql",
    migrations: {
      path: path.join(__dirname, "migrations"),
      generator: TSMigrationGenerator,
    },
  }
  ```

  2. Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa application:

  ```bash
  npx cross-env MIKRO_ORM_CLI=./src/modules/hello/mikro-orm.config.dev.ts mikro-orm migration:create
  ```

  <Note title="Tip">

  Add this command as a script in `package.json` for easy usage in the future. Use this command whenever you want to generate a new migration in your module.

  </Note>

  After running the command, a new file is created under the `src/modules/hello/migrations` directory. This file holds `up` and `down` methods that define the actions to execute when running and reverting the migration respectively.
  
</Details>

For example:

```ts title="src/modules/migrations/Migration20240429090012.ts"
import { Migration } from "@mikro-orm/migrations"

export class Migration20240429090012 extends Migration {

  async up(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("create table if not exists \"my_custom\" (\"id\" varchar(255) not null, \"name\" text not null, constraint \"my_custom_pkey\" primary key (\"id\"));")
  }

  async down(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("drop table if exists \"my_custom\" cascade;")
  }

}
```

In the `up` method, you create the table `my_custom` and define its columns. In the `down` method, you drop the table.

<Note title="Tip">

The queries performed in each of the methods use PostgreSQL syntax.

</Note>

### Add Migration to Module Definition

After creating the migration, you must add it to your module's definition.

To add a module's migrations to its definitions, use the `ModulesSdkUtils` utility functions imported from `@medusajs/utils`. It has functions to create and define the migration scripts in your module definition.

Change the content of `src/modules/hello.index.ts` that you created in a [previous chapter](../modules-and-services/page.mdx) to the following:

```ts title="src/modules/hello.index.ts" highlights={[["2"], ["6"], ["10"], ["12"], ["14"], ["18"], ["22"], ["28"], ["36"]]}
import HelloModuleService from "./service"
// add necessary imports
import { ModulesSdkUtils } from "@medusajs/utils"
import { MyCustom } from "./models/my-custom"

// define useful constants
const moduleName = "hello"
const pathToMigrations = __dirname + "/migrations"

// assemble object to pass to utility functions
const migrationScriptOptions = {
  // the module's name
  moduleName,
  // the data models of the modules
  models: {
    MyCustom,
  },
  // the path to the migrations directory
  pathToMigrations,
}

// create and export the script that runs migrations
export const runMigrations = ModulesSdkUtils
  .buildMigrationScript(
    migrationScriptOptions
  )

// create and export the script that reverts migrations
export const revertMigration = ModulesSdkUtils
  .buildRevertMigrationScript(
    migrationScriptOptions
  )

export default {
  service: HelloModuleService,
  // add the run and revert migration scripts 
  // to the module's definition
  runMigrations,
  revertMigration,
}
```

After importing `ModulesSdkUtils`, you use its `buildMigrationScript` function to create the script that runs the migration, and its `buildRevertMigrationScript` function to create the script that reverts the migration.

Both the `buildMigrationScript` and `buildRevertMigrationScript` accept the same object type as a parameter, which has the following properties:

- `moduleName`: The name of the module that the migrations belong to.
- `models`: An object of the module's data models.
- `pathToMigrations`: The path to the `migrations` directory.

Both created scripts must be exported in the file and within the module's definition object.

### Run Migration

To reflect the changes in the migration, transpile your source files using the `build` command, then run the `migration` command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
npx medusa migrations run
```

If ran successfully, the `my_custom` table will be created in the database.

## When to Use Data Models

<Note title="Use data models when" type="success">

- You want to store data related to your customization in the database.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use data models if" type="error">

- You want to store simple key-value pairs related to an existing data model. Instead, use the `metadata` field that most existing models have, which is an object of custom key-value pairs.

</Note>
