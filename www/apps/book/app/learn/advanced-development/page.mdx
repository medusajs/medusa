In the previous chapters, you got a brief introduction to Medusa’s basic concepts. However, to build a custom commerce application, you need a deeper understanding of how you utilize these concepts for your business use case.

The next chapters dive deeper into each concept. By the end of these chapters, you’ll be able to:

- Expose API routes with control over authentication.
- Build sophisticated business logic in modules and manage links between them.
- Create advanced workflows and configure retries and timeout.
- Add new pages to the Medusa Admin.
- Do more with subscribers, scheduled jobs, and other tools.
