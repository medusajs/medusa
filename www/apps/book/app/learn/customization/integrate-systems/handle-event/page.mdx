<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to emit an event when a brand is created, listen to that event in a subscriber, and create the brand in the third-party system as a step of the ["Integrate Systems" chapter](../page.mdx).

</Note>

## 1. Emit Custom Event for Brand Creation

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Brand Module with createBrandWorkflow",
      link: "/customization/custom-features/workflow"
    }
  ]}
/>

To handle brand-creation event, you'll emit a custom event when a brand is created.

In the `createBrandWorkflow` defined in `src/workflows/create-brand/index.ts`, use the `emitEventStep` helper step imported from `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` after the `createBrandStep`:

export const eventHighlights = [
  ["13", "emitEventStep", "Emit an event."],
  ["14", "eventName", "The event's name."],
  ["15", "data", "The data to pass in the payload."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/create-brand/index.ts" highlights={eventHighlights}
// other imports...
import { 
  emitEventStep,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

// ...

export const createBrandWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-brand",
  (input: CreateBrandInput) => {
    // ...

    emitEventStep({
      eventName: "brand.created",
      data: {
        id: brand.id,
      },
    })

    return new WorkflowResponse(brand)
  }
)
```

The `emitEventStep` accepts as a parameter an object having two properties:

- `eventName`: The name of the event to emit.
- `data`: The data payload to emit with the event. This is useful for subscribers to access the created brand.

---

## 2. Create Sync to Third-Party System Workflow

Next, you'll create the workflow that syncs the created brand to the third-party system.

Create the file `src/workflows/sync-brand-to-system/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/workflows/sync-brand-to-system/index.ts"
import {
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

export type SyncBrandToSystemInput = {
  id: string
}

export const syncBrandToSystemWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "sync-brand-to-system",
  (input: SyncBrandToSystemInput) => {
    // ...
  }
)
```

This defines an empty workflow and its expected input.

### Create createBrandInSystemStep

Next, create the step that syncs the brand in the file `src/workflows/sync-brand-to-system/steps/create-brand-in-system.ts`:

export const stepHighlights = [
  ["18", "createBrand", "Create a brand in the third-party system."],
  ["27", "deleteBrand", "Delete the brand in the third-party system if an error occurs."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/sync-brand-to-system/steps/create-brand-in-system.ts" highlights={stepHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-8" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { SyncBrandToSystemInput } from ".."
import BrandModuleService from "../../../modules/brand/service"
import { BRAND_MODULE } from "../../../modules/brand"

export const createBrandInSystemStep = createStep(
  "create-brand-in-system",
  async ({ id }: SyncBrandToSystemInput, { container }) => {
    const brandModuleService: BrandModuleService = container.resolve(
      BRAND_MODULE
    )

    const brand = await brandModuleService.retrieveBrand(id)
  
    await brandModuleService.client.createBrand(brand)

    return new StepResponse(null, brand.id)
  },
  async (id, { container }) => {
    const brandModuleService: BrandModuleService = container.resolve(
      BRAND_MODULE
    )

    await brandModuleService.client.deleteBrand(id)
  }
)
```

This step resolves the Brand Module's main service and uses its `client` property to access its internal service that integrates the third-party system.

In the step, you use the `createBrand` method of the client to create the brand in the third-party system.

In the compensation function, you undo the step's action using the `deleteBrand` method of the client.

### Add Step to Workflow

Finally, add this step to the `syncBrandToSystemWorkflow` in `src/workflows/sync-brand-to-system/index.ts`:

```ts title="src/workflows/sync-brand-to-system/index.ts"
// other imports...
import { createBrandInSystemStep } from "./steps/create-brand-in-system"

// ...

export const syncBrandToSystemWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "sync-brand-to-system",
  (input: SyncBrandToSystemInput) => {
    createBrandInSystemStep(input)

    return new WorkflowResponse(undefined)
  }
)
```

The workflow now calls the step and returns an `undefined` result.

---

## 3. Handle brand.created Event

To handle the `brand.created` event, create a subscriber at `src/subscribers/brand-created.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/subscribers/brand-created.ts"
import type {
  SubscriberConfig,
  SubscriberArgs,
} from "@medusajs/framework"
import { syncBrandToSystemWorkflow } from "../workflows/sync-brand-to-system"

export default async function brandCreatedHandler({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  await syncBrandToSystemWorkflow(container).run({
    input: data,
  })
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "brand.created",
}
```

The subscriber handler accesses the event payload in the `event.data` property of its object parameter.

<Note>

Learn more about subscribers [in this guide](../../../basics/events-and-subscribers/page.mdx).

</Note>

It then executes the `syncBrandToSystemWorkflow`, passing it the ID of the brand to create in the third-party system.

---

## Test it Out

To test it out, start the Medusa application and create a brand using the API route created in a [previous chapter](../../custom-features/api-route/page.mdx#test-api-route).

If you check the logs, you'll find the `brand.created` event was emitted, and that the request to the third-party system was simulated.

## Next Chapter: Sync Brand from Third-Party System to Medusa

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to sync brands in the third-party system into Medusa using a workflow and a scheduled job.
