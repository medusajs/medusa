## medusaIntegrationTestRunner Utility

The `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` utility function is provided by the `@medusajs/test-utils` package to create integration tests in your Medusa project. It runs a full Medusa application, allowing you test API routes, workflows, or other customizations.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["4", "api", "A set of utility methods used to send requests to the Medusa application."],
  ["4", "getContainer", "A function to retrieve the Medusa container."]
]

```ts title="integration-tests/http/test.spec.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { medusaIntegrationTestRunner } from "@medusajs/test-utils"

medusaIntegrationTestRunner({
  testSuite: ({ api, getContainer }) => {
    // TODO write tests...
  },
})
```

The `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` function accepts an object as a parameter. The object has a required property `testSuite`.

`testSuite`'s value is a function that defines the tests to run. The function accepts as a parameter an object that has the following properties:

- `api`: a set of utility methods used to send requests to the Medusa application. It has the following methods:
    - `get`: Send a `GET` request to an API route.
    - `post`: Send a `POST` request to an API route.
    - `delete`: Send a `DELETE` request to an API route.
- `getContainer`: a function that retrieves the Medusa Container. Use the `getContainer().resolve` method to resolve resources from the Medusa Container.

The tests in the `testSuite` function are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Run Tests

Run the following command to run your tests:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run test:integration
```

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't have a `test:integration` script in `package.json`, refer to the [Medusa Testing Tools chapter](../page.mdx#add-test-commands).

</Note>

This runs your Medusa application and runs the tests available under the `src/integrations/http` directory.

## Other Options and Inputs

Refer to [this reference in the Development Resources documentation](!resources!/test-tools-reference/medusaIntegrationTestRunner) for other available parameter options and inputs of the `testSuite` function.

---

## Database Used in Tests

The `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` function creates a database with a random name before running the tests. Then, it drops that database after all the tests end.

To manage that database, such as changing its name or perform operations on it in your tests, refer to the [references in the Development Resources documentation](!resources!/test-tools-reference/medusaIntegrationTestRunner).

## Example Integration Tests

The next chapters provide examples of writing integration tests for API routes and workflows.
