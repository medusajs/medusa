In this chapter, you'll learn about observability in Medusa and how to configure instrumentation with OpenTelemetry.

## Observability with OpenTelemtry

Medusa uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for instrumentation and reporting. When configured, it reports traces for:

- HTTP requests
- Workflow executions
- Query usages
- Database queries and operations

## How to Configure Instrumentation in Medusa?

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "An exporter to visualize your application's traces, such as Zipkin.",
      link: "https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html"
    }
  ]}
/>

### Install Dependencies

Start by installing the following OpenTelemetry dependencies in your Medusa project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node @opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg
```

Also, install the dependencies relevant for the exporter you use. If you're using Zipkin, install the following dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @opentelemetry/exporter-zipkin
```

### Add instrumentation.ts

Next, create the file `instrumentation.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="instrumentation.ts"
import { registerOtel } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { ZipkinExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-zipkin"

// If using an exporter other than Zipkin, initialize it here.
const exporter = new ZipkinExporter({
  serviceName: "my-medusa-project",
})

export function register() {
  registerOtel({
    serviceName: "medusajs",
    // pass exporter
    exporter,
    instrument: {
      http: true,
      workflows: true,
      query: true,
    },
  })
}
```

In the `instrumentation.ts` file, you export a `register` function that uses Medusa's `registerOtel` utility function.

You also initialize an instance of the exporter, such as Zipkin, and pass it to the `registerOtel` function.

The `registerOtel` utility function accepts an object having the following properties:

<TypeList
  types={[
    {
      name: "serviceName",
      type: "`string`",
      description: "The name of the service traced.",
      optional: false
    },
    {
      name: "exporter",
      type: "[SpanExporter](https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-js/interfaces/_opentelemetry_sdk_trace_base.SpanExporter.html)",
      description: "An instance of an exporter, such as Zipkin."
    },
    {
      name: "instrument",
      type: "`object`",
      description: "Options specifying what to trace.",
      optional: true,
      children: [
        {
          name: "http",
          type: "`boolean`",
          description: "Whether to trace HTTP requests."
        },
        {
          name: "query",
          type: "`boolean`",
          description: "Whether to trace Query usages."
        },
        {
          name: "workflows",
          type: "`boolean`",
          description: "Whether to trace Workflow executions."
        },
        {
          name: "db",
          type: "`boolean`",
          description: "Whether to trace database queries and operations."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "instrumentations",
      type: "[Instrumentation[]](https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-js/interfaces/_opentelemetry_instrumentation.Instrumentation.html)",
      description: "Additional instrumentation options that OpenTelemetry accepts.",
      optional: true
    }
  ]}
/>

## Test it Out

To test it out, start your exporter, such as Zipkin.

Then, start your Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Try to open the Medusa Admin or send a request to an API route.

If you check traces in your exporter, you'll find new traces reported.

### Trace Span Names

Trace span names start with the following keywords based on what it's reporting:

- `{methodName} {URL}` when reporting HTTP requests, where `{methodName}` is the HTTP method, and `{URL}` is the URL the request is sent to.
- `route:` when reporting route handlers running on an HTTP request.
- `middleware:` when reporting a middleware running on an HTTP request.
- `workflow:` when reporting a workflow execution.
- `step:` when reporting a step in a workflow execution.
- `query.graph:` when reporting Query usages.
- `pg.query:` when reporting database queries and operations.
