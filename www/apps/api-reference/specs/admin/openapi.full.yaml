So, if you have a Notification Service installed that can handle this event, a notification, such as an email, will be sent to the user. The token is triggered as part of the `user.password_reset` event's payload. That token must be used later to reset the password using the [Reset Password](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#users_postusersuserpassword) API Route.
