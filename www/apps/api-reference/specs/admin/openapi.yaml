    description: >
      Some plugins may require to authenticate with third-party services and
      store authentication details, such as the authentication token. To do
      that, they can create an Oauth provider within the plugin that handles the
      authentication.

      The Apps Oauth API Routes allows admins to manage and generate token for
      an app using its oauth provider.
  - name: Auth
    description: >
      Authentication API Routes allow admin users to manage their session, such

    description: >
      Publishable API Keys can be used to scope Store API calls with an API key,
      determining what resources are retrieved when querying the API.

      For example, a publishable API key can be associated with one or more
      sales channels. When it is passed in the header of a request to the List
      Product store API Route,

      the sales channels are inferred from the key and only products associated
      with those sales channels are retrieved.

      Admins can manage publishable API keys and their associated resources.
      Currently, only Sales Channels are supported as a resource.
