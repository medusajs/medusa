  description: >-
    Capture the draft order's payment. This will also set the draft order's
    status to `completed` and create an Order from the draft order. The payment
    is captured through Medusa's system payment, which is manual payment that
    isn't integrated with any third-party payment provider. It is assumed that
    the payment capturing is handled manually by the admin.
