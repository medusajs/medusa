    Start a product export process to retrieve a CSV of exported products.


    You'll receive in the response the transaction ID of the workflow generating
    the CSV file. To check the status of the execution, send a GET request to
    `/admin/workflows-executions/export-products/:transaction-id`.

    Once the execution finishes successfully, a notification is created for the
    export. You can retrieve the notifications using the `/admin/notification`
    API route to retrieve the file's download URL.
