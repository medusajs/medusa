        Complete a cart and place an order or create a swap, based on the cart's type. This includes attempting to authorize the cart's payment.
        If authorizing the payment requires more action, the cart will not be completed and the order will not be placed or the swap will not be created.

        An idempotency key will be generated if none is provided in the header `Idempotency-Key` and added to
        the response. If an error occurs during cart completion or the request is interrupted for any reason, the cart completion can be retried by passing the idempotency
        key in the `Idempotency-Key` header.

      description: |
        Retrieves a list of products. The products can be filtered by fields such as `id` or `q`. The products can also be sorted or paginated.
        This API Route can also be used to retrieve a product by its handle.

        For accurate and correct pricing of the products based on the customer's context, it's highly recommended to pass fields such as
        `region_id`, `currency_code`, and `cart_id` when available.

        Passing `sales_channel_id` ensures retrieving only products available in the specified sales channel.
        You can alternatively use a publishable API key in the request header instead of passing a `sales_channel_id`.

        Retrieve a Product's details. For accurate and correct pricing of the product based on the customer's context, it's highly recommended to pass fields such as
        `region_id`, `currency_code`, and `cart_id` when available.

        Passing `sales_channel_id` ensures retrieving only products available in the current sales channel.
        You can alternatively use a publishable API key in the request header instead of passing a `sales_channel_id`.

      summary: Create a Swap
      description: |
        Create a Swap for an Order. This will also create a return and associate it with the swap. If a return shipping option is specified, the return will automatically be fulfilled.
        To complete the swap, you must use the Complete Cart API Route passing it the ID of the swap's cart.

        An idempotency key will be generated if none is provided in the header `Idempotency-Key` and added to
        the response. If an error occurs during swap creation or the request is interrupted for any reason, the swap creation can be retried by passing the idempotency
        key in the `Idempotency-Key` header.

        Retrieves a list of product variants. The product variants can be filtered by fields such as `id` or `title`. The product variants can also be paginated.

        For accurate and correct pricing of the product variants based on the customer's context, it's highly recommended to pass fields such as
        `region_id`, `currency_code`, and `cart_id` when available.

        Passing `sales_channel_id` ensures retrieving only variants of products available in the specified sales channel.
        You can alternatively use a publishable API key in the request header instead of passing a `sales_channel_id`.

        Use a cookie session to send authenticated requests.

        ### How to Obtain the Cookie Session

        If you're sending requests through a browser, using JS Client, or using tools like Postman, the cookie session should be automatically set when the customer is logged in.

        If you're sending requests using cURL, you must set the Session ID in the cookie manually.

        To do that, send a request to [authenticate the customer](#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth) and pass the cURL option `-v`:

        ```bash
        curl -v --location --request POST 'https://medusa-url.com/store/auth' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "password": "supersecret"
        }'
        ```

        The headers will be logged in the terminal as well as the response. You should find in the headers a Cookie header similar to this:

        ```bash
        Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A2Bu8BkaP9JUfHu9rG59G16Ma0QZf6Gj1.WT549XqX37PN8n0OecqnMCq798eLjZC5IT7yiDCBHPM;
        ```

        Copy the value after `connect.sid` (without the `;` at the end) and pass it as a cookie in subsequent requests as the following:

        ```bash
        curl --location --request GET 'https://medusa-url.com/store/customers/me/orders' \
        --header 'Cookie: connect.sid={sid}'
        ```

        Where `{sid}` is the value of `connect.sid` that you copied.
