  summary: Get a Product
  description: >
    Retrieve a Product's details. For accurate and correct pricing of the
    product based on the customer's context, it's highly recommended to pass
    fields such as

    `region_id`, `currency_code`, and `cart_id` when available.


    Passing `sales_channel_id` ensures retrieving only products available in the
    current sales channel.

    You can alternatively use a publishable API key in the request header
    instead of passing a `sales_channel_id`.
