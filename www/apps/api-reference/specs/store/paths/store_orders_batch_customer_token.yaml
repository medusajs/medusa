  summary: Claim Order
  description: >-
    Allow the logged-in customer to claim ownership of one or more orders. This
    generates a token that can be used later on to verify the claim using the
    Verify Order Claim API Route. This also emits the event
    `order-update-token.created`. So, if you have a notification provider
    installed that handles this event and sends the customer a notification,
    such as an email, the customer should receive instructions on how to
    finalize their claim ownership.
