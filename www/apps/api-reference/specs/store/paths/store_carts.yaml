  summary: Create a Cart
  description: >
    Create a Cart. Although optional, specifying the cart's region and sales
    channel can affect the cart's pricing and

    the products that can be added to the cart respectively. So, make sure to
    set those early on and change them if necessary, such as when the customer
    changes their region.


    If a customer is logged in, make sure to pass its ID or email within the
    cart's details so that the cart is attached to the customer.
