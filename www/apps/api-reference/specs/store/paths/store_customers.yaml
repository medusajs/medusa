    Register a new customer. This will also automatically authenticate the
    customer and set their login session in the response Cookie header. The
    cookie session can be used in subsequent requests to authenticate the
    customer. When using Medusa's JS or Medusa React clients, the cookie is
    automatically attached to subsequent requests.
