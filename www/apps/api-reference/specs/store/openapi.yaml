        Use a cookie session to send authenticated requests.


        ### How to Obtain the Cookie Session


        If you're sending requests through a browser, using JS Client, or using
        tools like Postman, the cookie session should be automatically set when
        the customer is logged in.


        If you're sending requests using cURL, you must set the Session ID in
        the cookie manually.


        To do that, send a request to [authenticate the
        customer](#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth) and pass the cURL option `-v`:


        ```bash

        curl -v --location --request POST 'https://medusa-url.com/store/auth' \

        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

        --data-raw '{
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "password": "supersecret"
        }'

        ```


        The headers will be logged in the terminal as well as the response. You
        should find in the headers a Cookie header similar to this:


        ```bash

        Set-Cookie:
        connect.sid=s%3A2Bu8BkaP9JUfHu9rG59G16Ma0QZf6Gj1.WT549XqX37PN8n0OecqnMCq798eLjZC5IT7yiDCBHPM;

        ```


        Copy the value after `connect.sid` (without the `;` at the end) and pass
        it as a cookie in subsequent requests as the following:


        ```bash

        curl --location --request GET
        'https://medusa-url.com/store/customers/me/orders' \

        --header 'Cookie: connect.sid={sid}'

        ```


        Where `{sid}` is the value of `connect.sid` that you copied.
