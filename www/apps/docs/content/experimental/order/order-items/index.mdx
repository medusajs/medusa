## Item’s Product Details

The details of the purchased products are represented by the `LineItem` data model. Not only does a line item hold the details of the product, but also details related to its price, adjustments due to promotions, and taxes.

<Note>

The `LineItem` data model is similar to the Cart Module’s `LineItem` data model. So, when using both modules, the data can be copied between the modules as-is.
