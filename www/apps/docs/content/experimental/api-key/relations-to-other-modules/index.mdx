# Relations between API Key Module and Other Modules

When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the API Key Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Sales Channel Module

You can create a publishable API key and associate it with a sales channel. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ApiKey` and the `SalesChannel` data models.

This is useful to avoid passing the sales channel's ID as a parameter of every request, and instead pass the publishable API key in the header of any request to the Store API route.

Learn more about this in the [Sales Channel Module's documentation](../../sales-channel/publishable-api-keys/page.mdx).
