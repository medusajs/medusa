# Tax Module Options

In this document, you'll learn about the options of the Tax Module.

## providers

The `providers` option is an array of either tax provider modules, tax plugins, or path to a file that defines a tax provider.

When the Medusa application starts, these providers are registered and can be used to retrieve tax lines.

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const modules = {
  // ...
  tax: {
    resolve: "@medusajs/tax",
    options: {
      providers: [
        {
          resolve: "my-provider",
          options: {
            // ...
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

The objects in the array accept the following properties:

- `resolve`: A string indicating the package name of the tax provider module or the tax plugin, or the path to the file defining the tax provider.
- `options`: An object of options to pass to the tax provider.
