# Fulfillment Module Options

In this document, you'll learn about the options of the Fulfillment Module.

## providers

The `providers` option is an array of either fulfillment provider modules, fulfillment plugins, or path to a file that holds a fulfillment provider.

When the Medusa application starts, these providers are registered and can be used to process fulfillments.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const modules = {
  // ...
  fulfillment: {
    resolve: "@medusajs/fulfillment",
    options: {
      providers: [
        {
          resolve: `@medusajs/fulfillment-manual`,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

The `providers` option is an array of objects that accept the following properties:

- `resolve`: A string indicating the package name of the fulfillment provider module or the fulfillment plugin, or the path to the file defining the fulfillment provider.
- `options`: An optional object of options to pass to the fulfillment provider.
