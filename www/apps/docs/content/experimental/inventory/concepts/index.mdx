# Inventory Concepts

In this document, you’ll learn about the main concepts in the Inventory Module, and how data is stored and related.

## InventoryItem

An inventory item, represented by the `InventoryItem` data model, is a stock-kept item, such as a product, whose inventory can be managed.

The `InventoryItem` data model mainly holds details related to the underlying stock item, but has relations to other data models that include its inventory details.

## InventoryLevel

An inventory level, represented by the `InventoryLevel` data model, holds the inventory and quantity details of an inventory item in a specific location.

It has three quantity-related attributes:

- `stocked_quantity`: The available stock quantity of an item in the associated location.
- `reserved_quantity`: The quantity reserved from the available `stocked_quantity`. It indicates the quantity that's still not removed from stock, but considered as unavailable when checking whether an item is in stock.
- `incoming_quantity`: The incoming stock quantity of an item into the associated location. This attribute doesn't play into the `stocked_quantity` or when checking whether an item is in stock.

### Associated Location

The inventory level's location is determined by the `location_id` attribute. The Medusa application links the `InventoryLevel` data model with the `StockLocation` data model from the Stock Location Module.

## ReservationItem

A reservation item, represented by the `ReservationItem` data model, represents unavailable quantity of an inventory item in a location. It's used when an order is placed but not fulfilled yet.

The reserved quantity is associated with a location, so it has a similar relation to that of the `InventoryLevel` with the Stock Location Module.
