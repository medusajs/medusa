# Relations between Inventory Module and Other Modules

When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Inventory Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Product Module

Each product variant has different inventory details. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ProductVariant` and `InventoryItem` data models.

A product variant, whose `manage_inventory` attribute is enabled, has an associated inventory item. Through that inventory's items relations in the Inventory Module, you can manage and check the variant's inventory quantity.

## Stock Location Module

Reservation items and inventory items are associated with a location. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ReservationItem` and `StockLocation` data models, and the `InventoryLevel` and `StockLocation` data models.

The stock location provides address details of the location.
