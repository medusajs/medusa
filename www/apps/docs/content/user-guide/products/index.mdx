# Products Overview

In this document, you’ll get an overview of the product listing page and all the things you can do with it.

## Overview

Products are the goods you sell in your store. They can be physical or digital products. They can also be simple products or products with variants.

You can create products and edit their details. That includes basic info, sales channels, inventory management, prices management, and much more.

Part of the product domain is Categories. Categories allow you to organize products into more than one category. You can also manage the hierarchy of the category. An example of a category could be "Women" with "Shirt" as a nested category.

Another part of the domain is Collections. Collections are used to split products for a marketing or sales purpose. For example, you can create a "Summer Collection" to showcase products for the summer.
