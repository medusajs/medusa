# Manage Products

In this document, you’ll learn how to create new products, edit different fields and areas in a product, and more.

## Create a Product

To create a new product:

1. Go to the Products page.
2. Click on the New Product button at the top right.

This opens a new form with different sections. The only field required is the Title field in the General Information Section.

### General Information Section

1. Enter the required field Title.
2. If you don’t provide a value for the Handle field, it will be generated from the title.
3. If you don’t want discounts to be applied to this product, toggle the Discountable field off.
4. Optionally enter the rest of the general information fields.

### Organize Section

:::note

If you don't see a categories field, it's because this feature is currently in beta and must be manually enabled by your technical team.

:::

All fields in this section allow you to better group and filter your products using types, collections, and tags.

1. You can either choose from a list of types or create a new one.
2. You can choose from a list of collections.
3. You can choose one or more categories. If you don't have any categories, you can learn how to create them in the [Manage Categories documentation](./categories.mdx). If you want to choose a nested category, you can click on a parent category which will show the categories nested inside it.
4. Tags are comma-separated. After entering a tag’s value, add a comma “,” and it will create the tag. You can remove the tag by pressing the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999180/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/kvGRHQR_s0ptsm.png" darkIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999200/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/RJ4SLIu_n30zqr.png" alt="X" /> icon next to it.
