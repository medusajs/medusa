# Manage Payment and Fulfillment Providers in a Region

In this document, you’ll learn how to manage a region’s payment and fulfillment providers in your Medusa Admin.

## Overview

You can choose the payment and fulfillment providers available in each region. This allows you to provide customers in specific regions the providers that are available in their country or region.

When a payment or fulfillment provider is added to a region, it means a customer is able to select that payment or fulfillment provider during checkout to complete their purchase.
