# Manage Team

In this document, you’ll learn how to invite new users, edit other users’ information, and remove users from your team.

## View your Team

You can view your team by going to Settings → The Team.

---

## Manage Invites

To add a new user to your team, you must invite them. Invites are sent by email, but you can also copy the invite link and send it personally to the user.

:::note

By default, your store doesn't handle sending invites to the user through a notification, such as an email. Your developer team must setup and configure a Notification service that handles this functionality.

:::

### Invite a User

To send an invite to a user:

1. Go to your team page.
2. Click on the Invite Users button.
3. Enter the user’s email and choose their role.
4. Once done, click on the Invite button.

:::tip

A user's role doesn't actually change the user's privileges. All users have the same admin privileges.
