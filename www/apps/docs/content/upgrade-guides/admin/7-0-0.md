# Medusa Admin: v7.0.0

Version 7.0.0 introduces Admin Extensions, which were previously available as a `beta` version. By upgrading to this version, you'll be able to create admin [widgets](../../admin/widgets.md), [UI routes](../../admin/routes.md), and [setting pages](../../admin/setting-pages.md).

This version also introduces a breaking change to the `path` configuration of the admin plugin.

---

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa backend to update the admin plugin:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/admin@7.0.0
```

## Actions Required

### Path Configuration

Previously, the `path` configuration of the admin plugin set in `medusa-config.js` expected the path to not include a backslash `/` at its beginning or its end.

Starting from v7.0.0 of `@medusajs/admin`, the `path` configuration is required to start with a `/`, but not end with one.

For example, if you've set the admin configuration as follows:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      path: "admin",
      // ...
    },
  },
]
```

You should change the value of `path` to `/admin`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      path: "/admin",
      // ...
    },
  },
]
```
