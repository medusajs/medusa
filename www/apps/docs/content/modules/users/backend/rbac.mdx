# Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

In this document, you'll get a high-level overview of how you can implement role-based access control (RBAC) in your Medusa backend.

## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) refers to the level of access a user has. Typically, in e-commerce, you may require RBAC if you want users to only be able to perform certain actions. 

For example, you may want a content-manager user who can only access CMS functionalities and another manager user who can only access order functionalities. RBAC is also useful in [marketplace use cases](../../../recipes/marketplace.mdx).

This guide gives you a high-level approach to implementing RBAC in Medusa. The examples included in this guide provide a simple implementation to give you an idea of how you can implement this functionality in your Medusa backend.

---

## Create Role and Permission Entities

When implementing RBAC, you typically require the availability of roles and permissions. A role would include different permissions, such as the ability to access the products’ route, and it can be assigned to one or more users.

So, the first step would be to create the `Role` and `Permission` entities to represent this data. Also, since you’ll be creating relations to other entities, such as the `User` entity, you need to extend the core entities to implement these relations.

    }
  },
]} />

<Details>
  <Summary>Example Implementation</Summary>

  This is an example implementation of how you can create the Role and Permission entities, and extend the `User` and `Store` entities.

  Creating an entity requires creating an entity class, a repository, and a migration. You can learn more [here](../../../development/entities/create.mdx). You’ll be creating the migration at the end of this example section.

  Create the file `src/models/role.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/models/role.ts"
  import { 
    BeforeInsert, 
    Column, 
    Entity,
    Index,
    JoinColumn,
    JoinTable,
    ManyToMany,
    ManyToOne,
    OneToMany, 
  } from "typeorm"
  import { BaseEntity } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { generateEntityId } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/utils"
  import { Permission } from "./permission"
  import { User } from "./user"
  import { Store } from "./store"

  @Entity()
  export class Role extends BaseEntity {
    @Column({ type: "varchar" })
    name: string

    // only helpful if you're integrating in a marketplace
    @Index()
    @Column({ nullable: true })
    store_id: string

    @ManyToMany(() => Permission)
    @JoinTable({
      name: "role_permissions",
      joinColumn: {
        name: "role_id",
        referencedColumnName: "id",
      },
      inverseJoinColumn: {
        name: "permission_id",
        referencedColumnName: "id",
      },
    })
    permissions: Permission[]

    @OneToMany(() => User, (user) => user.teamRole)
    @JoinColumn({ name: "id", referencedColumnName: "role_id" })
    users: User[]

    @ManyToOne(() => Store, (store) => store.roles)
    @JoinColumn({ name: "store_id" })
    store: Store

    @BeforeInsert()
    private beforeInsert(): void {
      this.id = generateEntityId(this.id, "role")
    }
  }
  ```

  This creates the `Role` entity. You’ll see errors in your editors, which you’ll resolve by following along the example.

  The `Role` entity has the following attributes:

  - `id`: the ID of the role, which is available implicitly by extending `BaseEntity`
  - `name`: the name of the role
  - `store_id`: the ID of the store this role belongs to. This is only useful if you’re implementing RBAC in a marketplace. Otherwise, you may omit this relation.

  It also has the following relations:

  - `permissions`: an array of permissions included in this role.
  - `store`: the Store this role belongs to.
  - `users`: the users associated with this role.

  Then, create the file `src/repositories/role.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/repositories/role.ts"
  import { Role } from "../models/role"
  import { 
    dataSource,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/database"

  export const RoleRepository = dataSource
    .getRepository(Role)

  export default RoleRepository
  ```

  Next, create the file `src/models/permission.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/models/permission.ts"
  import { 
    BeforeInsert, 
    Column, 
    Entity,
    JoinTable,
    ManyToMany, 
  } from "typeorm"
  import { BaseEntity } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { 
    DbAwareColumn,
    generateEntityId,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/utils"
  import { Role } from "./role"

  @Entity()
  export class Permission extends BaseEntity {
    @Column({ type: "varchar" })
    name: string

    // holds the permissions
    @DbAwareColumn({ type: "jsonb", nullable: true })
    metadata: Record<string, boolean>

    @BeforeInsert()
    private beforeInsert(): void {
      this.id = generateEntityId(this.id, "perm")
    }
  }
  ```

  This creates a `Permission` entity that has the following attributes:

  - `id`: the ID of the permission, which is implicitly available through extending `BaseEntity`.
  - `name`: the name of the permission.
  - `metadata`: an object that will include the permissions. The object keys will be an admin path in the backend, and the value will be a boolean indicating whether the user has access to that path or not.

  Then, create the file `src/repositories/permission.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/repositories/permission.ts"
  import { Permission } from "../models/permission"
  import { 
    dataSource,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/database"

  export const PermissionRepository = dataSource
    .getRepository(Permission)

  export default PermissionRepository
  ```

  Next, you’ll extend the `User` and `Store` entities. As mentioned earlier, extending the `Store` entity and adding the relation is only useful if you’re implementing RBAC in a marketplace or similar use cases. So, if this doesn’t apply to you, you may skip it.

  Create the file `src/models/user.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/models/user.ts"
  import { 
    Column,
    Entity,
    Index,
    JoinColumn,
    ManyToOne,
  } from "typeorm"
  import {
    // alias the core entity to not cause a naming conflict
    User as MedusaUser,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { Role } from "./role"

  @Entity()
  export class User extends MedusaUser {
    @Index()
    @Column({ nullable: true })
    role_id: string | null

    @ManyToOne(() => Role, (role) => role.users)
    @JoinColumn({ name: "role_id" })
    teamRole: Role | null
  }
  ```

  This adds a new attribute `role_id` to the core `User` entity and a `teamRole` relation that optionally associates the user with a role.

  Next, create the file `src/models/store.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/models/store.ts"
  import { Entity, JoinColumn, OneToMany } from "typeorm"
  import {
    // alias the core entity to not cause a naming conflict
    Store as MedusaStore,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { Role } from "./role"

  @Entity()
  export class Store extends MedusaStore {
    @OneToMany(() => Role, (role) => role.store)
    @JoinColumn({ name: "id", referencedColumnName: "store_id" })
    roles: Role[]
  }
  ```

  This adds a `roles` relation to the core `Store` entity.

  Optionally, if you’re using TypeScript, create the file `src/index.d.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/index.d.ts"
  import { Role } from "./models/role"

  export declare module "@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/user" {

    declare interface User {
      role_id: string | null;
      teamRole: Role | null
    }

    declare interface Store {
      roles: Role[]
    }
  }
  ```

  This ensures that your TypeScript validation and editor autocomplete recognize the new attributes and relations you added on the core entities.

  Finally, you need to create a migration to reflect these changes in the database.

  You can learn about creating migrations [here](../../../development/entities/migrations/create.md). An example of a migration file based on the entities created above:

<!-- eslint-disable max-len -->

  ```ts title="src/migrations/1693225851284-AddRolesAndPermissions.ts"
  import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner, Table, TableIndex } from "typeorm"

  export class AddRolesAndPermissions1693225851284 implements MigrationInterface {

      public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "user" ADD "role_id" character varying`)
          await queryRunner.query(`CREATE TABLE "permission" ("id" character varying NOT NULL, "created_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), "updated_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), "name" character varying NOT NULL, "metadata" jsonb, CONSTRAINT "PK_3b8b97af9d9d8807e41e6f48362" PRIMARY KEY ("id"))`)
          await queryRunner.query(`CREATE TABLE "role" ("id" character varying NOT NULL, "created_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), "updated_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), "name" character varying NOT NULL, "store_id" character varying, CONSTRAINT "PK_b36bcfe02fc8de3c57a8b2391c2" PRIMARY KEY ("id"))`)
          await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX "IDX_29259dd58b1052aef9be56941d" ON "role" ("store_id") `)
          await queryRunner.query(`CREATE TABLE "role_permissions" ("role_id" character varying NOT NULL, "permission_id" character varying NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT "PK_25d24010f53bb80b78e412c9656" PRIMARY KEY ("role_id", "permission_id"))`)
          await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX "IDX_178199805b901ccd220ab7740e" ON "role_permissions" ("role_id") `)
          await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX "IDX_17022daf3f885f7d35423e9971" ON "role_permissions" ("permission_id") `)

          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "role_permissions" ADD CONSTRAINT "FK_178199805b901ccd220ab7740ec" FOREIGN KEY ("role_id") REFERENCES "role"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE`)
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "role_permissions" ADD CONSTRAINT "FK_17022daf3f885f7d35423e9971e" FOREIGN KEY ("permission_id") REFERENCES "permission"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE`)
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "user" ADD CONSTRAINT "FK_fb2e442d14add3cefbdf33c4561" FOREIGN KEY ("role_id") REFERENCES "role"("id") ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION`)
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "role" ADD CONSTRAINT "FK_29259dd58b1052aef9be56941d4" FOREIGN KEY ("store_id") REFERENCES "store"("id") ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION`)
          await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX "IDX_fb2e442d14add3cefbdf33c456" ON "user" ("role_id") `)
      }

      public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "role_permissions" DROP CONSTRAINT "FK_17022daf3f885f7d35423e9971e"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "role_permissions" DROP CONSTRAINT "FK_178199805b901ccd220ab7740ec"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "role" DROP CONSTRAINT "FK_29259dd58b1052aef9be56941d4"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`DROP INDEX "public"."IDX_fb2e442d14add3cefbdf33c456"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "user" DROP CONSTRAINT "FK_fb2e442d14add3cefbdf33c4561"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN "role_id"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`DROP INDEX "public"."IDX_17022daf3f885f7d35423e9971"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`DROP INDEX "public"."IDX_178199805b901ccd220ab7740e"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE "role_permissions"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`DROP INDEX "public"."IDX_29259dd58b1052aef9be56941d"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE "role"`)
          await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE "permission"`)
      }

  }
  ```

  Finally, to reflect these changes, run the `build` command in the root directory of your medusa backend:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm run build
  ```

  Then, run the migrations:

  ```bash
  npx medusa migrations run
  ```

  This will reflect the entity changes in your database.

## Create Guard Middleware

To ensure that users who have the privilege can access an API Route, you must create a middleware that guards admin routes. This middleware will run on all authenticated admin requests to ensure that only allowed users can access an API Route.

Since the Medusa backend uses Express, you can create a middleware and attach it to all admin routes.

<DocCard item={{
  type: 'link',
  href: '/development/api-routes/add-middleware',
  label: 'Create a Middleware',
  customProps: {
    icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
    description: 'Learn how to create a middleware in Medusa.',
  }
}} />

<Details>
  <Summary>Example Implementation</Summary>

  In this example, you’ll create a middleware that runs on all admin-authenticated routes and checks the logged-in user’s permissions before giving them access to an API Route.

  Create the file `src/api/middlewares.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts"
  import type { 
    MiddlewaresConfig, 
    UserService,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import express from "express"
  import type { 
    MedusaRequest, 
    MedusaResponse, 
    MedusaNextFunction,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"

  export const permissions = async (
    req: MedusaRequest,
    res: MedusaResponse,
    next: MedusaNextFunction
  ) => {
    if (!req.user || !req.user.userId) {
      next()
      return
    }
    // retrieve currently logged-in user
    const userService = req.scope.resolve(
      "userService"
    ) as UserService
    const loggedInUser = await userService.retrieve(
      req.user.userId,
      {
        select: ["id"],
        relations: ["teamRole", "teamRole.permissions"],
      })

    if (!loggedInUser.teamRole) {
      // considered as super user
      next()
      return
    }

    const isAllowed = loggedInUser.teamRole?.permissions.some(
      (permission) => {
        const metadataKey = Object.keys(permission.metadata).find(
          (key) => key === req.path
        )
        if (!metadataKey) {
          return false
        }
    
        // boolean value
        return permission.metadata[metadataKey]
      }
    )

    if (isAllowed) {
      next()
      return
    }

    // deny access
    res.sendStatus(401)
  }

  export const config: MiddlewaresConfig = {
    routes: [
      {
        matcher: "/admin/*",
        middlewares: [permissions],
      },
    ],
  }
  ```

  In this middleware, you ensure that there is a logged-in user and the logged-in user has a role. If not, the user is admitted to access the API Route. Here, you presume that logged-in users who don’t have a role are “super-admin” users who can access all API Routes. You may choose to implement this differently.

  If there’s a logged-in user that has a role, you check that the role’s permissions give them access to the current API Route. You do that by checking if a permission’s metadata has a key with the same request’s path. It may be better here to check for matching using regular expressions, for example, to check routes with path parameters.

  Otherwise, if the user’s role doesn’t provide them with enough permissions, you return a `401` response code.

  :::tip

  Notice that you use `req.path` here to get the current API Route path. However, in middlewares, this doesn’t include the mount point which is `/admin`. So, for example, if the API Route path is `/admin/products`, `req.path` will be `/products`. You can alternatively use `req.originalUrl`. Learn more in [Express’s documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.originalUrl).

  :::

  After defining the middleware, you apply it on all API Routes starting with `/admin/`.

</Details>

---

## Create API Routes and Services

To manage the roles and permissions, you’ll need to create custom API Routes, typically for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

You’ll also need to create a service for each of `Role` and `Permission` entities to perform these operations on them. The entity uses the service within its code.

Furthermore, you may need to extend core services if you need to perform actions on core entities that you’ve extended, such as the `User` entity.

<DocCardList colSize={4} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',

    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to extend a core service in Medusa',
    }
  },
]} />

<Details>
  <Summary>Example Implementation</Summary>

  In this example, you’ll only implement two API Routes for simplicity: create role API Route that create a new role with permissions, and associate user API Route that associates a user with a role.

  You’ll also create basic services for `Role` and `Permission` to perform the functionalities of each of these API Routes and extend the core `UserService` to allow associating roles with users.

  Start by creating the file `src/services/permission.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/services/permission.ts"
  import { TransactionBaseService } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { Permission } from "../models/permission"
  import PermissionRepository from "../repositories/permission"  

  export type CreatePayload = Pick<
    Permission,
    "name" | "metadata"
  >

  type InjectedDependencies = {
    permissionRepository: typeof PermissionRepository
  }

  class PermissionService extends TransactionBaseService {
    protected readonly permissionRepository_:
      typeof PermissionRepository
    
    constructor(container: InjectedDependencies) {
      super(container)
      this.permissionRepository_ = container.permissionRepository
    }

    async create(data: CreatePayload) {
      // omitting validation for simplicity
      return this.atomicPhase_(async (manager) => {
        const permissionRepo = manager.withRepository(
          this.permissionRepository_
        )
        const permission = permissionRepo.create(data)

        const result = await permissionRepo.save(permission)

        return result
      })
    }
  }

  export default PermissionService
  ```

  This creates the `PermissionService` with only a `create` method that can be used to create a permission.

  Next, create the file `src/services/user.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/services/user.ts"
  import {
    UserService as MedusaUserService, User,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { 
    UpdateUserInput,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/types/user"

  class UserService extends MedusaUserService {
    async update(userId: string, update: UpdateUserInput & {
      role_id?: string
    }): Promise<User> {
      return super.update(userId, update)
    }
  }

  export default UserService
  ```

  This extends the core `UserService` to allow updating a user’s role. You may also want to extend the `create` method to allow specifying the role on creation.

  Then, create the file `src/services/role.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/services/role.ts"
  import { TransactionBaseService } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { Role } from "../models/role"
  import RoleRepository from "../repositories/role"
  import PermissionService, { 
    CreatePayload as PermissionCreatePayload,
  } from "./permission"
  import UserService from "./user"

  type CreatePayload = Pick<Role, "name" | "store_id"> & {
    permissions?: PermissionCreatePayload[]
  }

  type InjectedDependencies = {
    roleRepository: typeof RoleRepository
    permissionService: PermissionService
    userService: UserService
  }

  class RoleService extends TransactionBaseService {
    protected readonly roleRpository_: typeof RoleRepository
    protected readonly permissionService_: PermissionService
    protected readonly userService_: UserService

    constructor(container: InjectedDependencies) {
      super(container)

      this.roleRpository_ = container.roleRepository
      this.permissionService_ = container.permissionService
      this.userService_ = container.userService
    }

    async retrieve(id: string): Promise<Role> {
      // for simplicity, we retrieve all relations
      // however, it's best to supply the relations
      // as an optional method parameter
      const roleRepo = this.manager_.withRepository(
        this.roleRpository_
      )
      return await roleRepo.findOne({
        where: {
          id,
        },
        relations: [
          "permissions",
          "store",
          "users",
        ],
      })
    }

    async create(data: CreatePayload): Promise<Role> {
      return this.atomicPhase_(async (manager) => {
        // omitting validation for simplicity
        const { permissions: permissionsData = [] } = data
        delete data.permissions
        
        const roleRepo = manager.withRepository(
          this.roleRpository_
        )
        const role = roleRepo.create(data)

        role.permissions = []

        for (const permissionData of permissionsData) {
          role.permissions.push(
            await this.permissionService_.create(
              permissionData
            )
          )
        }
        const result = await roleRepo.save(role)

        return await this.retrieve(result.id)
      })
    }

    async associateUser(
      role_id: string,
      user_id: string
    ): Promise<Role> {
      return this.atomicPhase_(async () => {
        // omitting validation for simplicity
        await this.userService_.update(user_id, {
          role_id,
        })

        return await this.retrieve(role_id)
      })
    }
  }

  export default RoleService
  ```

  This creates the `RoleService` with three methods:

  - `retrieve`: Retrieves a role with its relations.
  - `create`: Creates a new role and, if provided, its permissions as well.
  - `associateUser`: associates a user with a role.

  Now, you can create the API Routes.

  Start by creating the file `src/api/admin/roles/route.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/api/admin/roles/route.ts"
  import type { 
    MedusaRequest, 
    MedusaResponse,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import RoleService from "../../../../services/role"

  export const POST = async (
    req: MedusaRequest, 
    res: MedusaResponse
  ) => {
    // omitting validation for simplicity
    const {
      name,
      store_id,
      permissions = [],
    } = req.body

    const roleService = req.scope.resolve(
      "roleService"
    ) as RoleService

    const role = await roleService.create({
      name,
      store_id,
      permissions,
    })

    res.json(role)
  }
  ```

  This creates the Create Role API Route at `/admin/roles` that uses the `RoleService` to create a new role. Notice that validation of received body parameters is omitted for simplicity.

  Next, create the file `src/api/routes/admin/roles/[id]/user/[user_id]/route.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/api/routes/admin/roles/[id]/user/[user_id]/route.ts"
  import type { 
    MedusaRequest, 
    MedusaResponse,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import RoleService from "../../../../services/role"

  export const POST = async (
    req: MedusaRequest, 
    res: MedusaResponse
  ) => {
    // omitting validation for simplicity purposes
    const {
      id,
      user_id,
    } = req.params

    const roleService = req.scope.resolve(
      "roleService"
    ) as RoleService
    const role = await roleService.associateUser(id, user_id)

    res.json(role)
  }
  ```

  This creates the Associate User API Route at `/admin/roles/[id]/user/[user_id]` that uses the `RoleService` to associate a role with a user.

  To test the API Routes out, run the `build` command in the root directory of your Medusa backend project:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm run build
  ```

  Then, start the backend with the following command:

  ```bash
  npx medusa develop
  ```

  Try first to log in using the [Admin User Login API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#auth_postauth) with an existing admin user. Then, send a `POST` request to the `localhost:9000/admin/roles` API Route with the following request body parameters:

  ```json
  {
    "store_id": "store_01H8XPDY8WA1Z650MZSEY4Y0V0",
    "name": "Product Manager",
    "permissions": [
      {
        "name": "Allow Products",
        "metadata": {
            "/products": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Make sure to replace the `store_id`'s value with your store’s ID. You can retrieve the store’s ID using the [Get Store Details API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#store_getstore).

  This will create a new role with a permission that allows users of this role to access the `/admin/products` API Route. As mentioned before, because of the middleware’s implementation, you must specify the path without the `/admin` prefix. If you chose to implement this differently, such as with regular expressions, then change the permission’s metadata accordingly.

  Next, create a new user using the [Create User API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#users_postusers). Then, send a `POST` request to `localhost:9000/admin/roles/<role_id>/user/<user_id>`, where `<role_id>` is the ID of the role you created, and `<user_id>` is the ID of the user you created. This will associate the user with the role you created.

  Finally, login with the user you created, then try to access any API Route other than `/admin/products`. You’ll receive a `401` unauthorized response. Then, try to access the [List Products API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#products_getproducts), and the user should be able to access it as expected.
