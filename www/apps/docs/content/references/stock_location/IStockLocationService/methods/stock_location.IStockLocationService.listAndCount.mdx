# listAndCount

This method is used to retrieve a paginated list of stock locations along with the total count of available stock locations satisfying the provided filters.

## Example

To retrieve a list of stock locations using their IDs:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializeStockLocationModule,
} from "@medusajs/stock-location"

async function listStockLocations (ids: string[]) {
  const stockLocationModule = await initializeStockLocationModule({})

  const [stockLocations, count] = await stockLocationModule.listAndCount({
    id: ids
  })

  // do something with the stock locations or return them
}
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the stock locations:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializeStockLocationModule,
} from "@medusajs/stock-location"

async function listStockLocations (ids: string[]) {
  const stockLocationModule = await initializeStockLocationModule({})

  const [stockLocations, count] = await stockLocationModule.listAndCount({
    id: ids
  }, {
    relations: ["address"]
  })

  // do something with the stock locations or return them
}
```

By default, only the first `10` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializeStockLocationModule,
} from "@medusajs/stock-location"

async function listStockLocations (ids: string[], skip: number, take: number) {
  const stockLocationModule = await initializeStockLocationModule({})

  const [stockLocations, count] = await stockLocationModule.listAndCount({
    id: ids
  }, {
    relations: ["address"],
    skip,
    take
  })

  // do something with the stock locations or return them
}
```
