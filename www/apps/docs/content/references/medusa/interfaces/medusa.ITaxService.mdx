# ITaxService

## Overview

A tax provider is used to retrieve the tax lines in a cart. The Medusa backend provides a default `system` provider. You can create your own tax provider,
either in a plugin or directly in your Medusa backend, then use it in any region.

A tax provider class is defined in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/services` directory and the class must extend the
`AbstractTaxService` class imported from `@medusajs/medusa`. The file's name is the tax provider's class name as a slug and without the word `Service`.

For example, you can create the file `src/services/my-tax.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/services/my-tax.ts"
import {
  AbstractTaxService,
  ItemTaxCalculationLine,
  ShippingTaxCalculationLine,
  TaxCalculationContext,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import {
  ProviderTaxLine,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/types/tax-service"

class MyTaxService extends AbstractTaxService {
  async getTaxLines(
    itemLines: ItemTaxCalculationLine[],
    shippingLines: ShippingTaxCalculationLine[],
    context: TaxCalculationContext):
    Promise<ProviderTaxLine[]> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
}

export default MyTaxService
```

## Identifier Property

The `TaxProvider` entity has 2 properties: `identifier` and `is_installed`. The `identifier` property in the tax provider service is used when the tax provider is added to the database.

The value of this property is also used to reference the tax provider throughout Medusa. For example, it is used to [change the tax provider](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/taxes/admin/manage-tax-settings#change-tax-provider-of-a-region) to a region.

```ts title="src/services/my-tax.ts"
class MyTaxService extends AbstractTaxService {
  static identifier = "my-tax"
  // ...
}
```

## Methods

### getTaxLines

This method is used when retrieving the tax lines for line items and shipping methods.
This occurs during checkout or when calculating totals for orders, swaps, or returns.

#### Example

An example of how this method is implemented in the `system` provider implemented in the Medusa backend:

```ts
// ...

class SystemTaxService extends AbstractTaxService {
  // ...

  async getTaxLines(
    itemLines: ItemTaxCalculationLine[],
    shippingLines: ShippingTaxCalculationLine[],
    context: TaxCalculationContext
  ): Promise<ProviderTaxLine[]> {
    let taxLines: ProviderTaxLine[] = itemLines.flatMap((l) => {
      return l.rates.map((r) => ({
        rate: r.rate || 0,
        name: r.name,
        code: r.code,
        item_id: l.item.id,
      }))
    })

    taxLines = taxLines.concat(
      shippingLines.flatMap((l) => {
        return l.rates.map((r) => ({
          rate: r.rate || 0,
          name: r.name,
          code: r.code,
          shipping_method_id: l.shipping_method.id,
        }))
      })
    )

    return taxLines
  }
}
```
