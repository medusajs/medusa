# ITaxCalculationStrategy

## Overview

A tax calculation strategy is used to calculate taxes when calculating a cart's totals. The Medusa
backend provides a tax calculation strategy that handles calculating the taxes, taking into account the
defined tax rates and settings such as whether tax-inclusive pricing is enabled.

You can override the tax calculation strategy to implement different calculation logic or to
integrate a third-party service that handles the tax calculation. You can override it either
in a Medusa backend setup or in a plugin.

A tax calculation strategy should be defined in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created under the `src/strategies` directory.
The class must also implement the `ITaxCalculationStrategy` interface imported from the `@medusajs/medusa` package.

For example, you can create the file `src/strategies/tax-calculation.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/strategies/tax-calculation.ts"
import {
  ITaxCalculationStrategy,
  LineItem,
  LineItemTaxLine,
  ShippingMethodTaxLine,
  TaxCalculationContext,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

class TaxCalculationStrategy
  implements ITaxCalculationStrategy {

  async calculate(
    items: LineItem[],
    taxLines: (ShippingMethodTaxLine | LineItemTaxLine)[],
    calculationContext: TaxCalculationContext
  ): Promise<number> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }

}

export default TaxCalculationStrategy
```

## Methods

### calculate

This method calculates the tax amount for a given set of line items under applicable
tax conditions and calculation contexts.

This method is used whenever taxes are calculated. If automatic tax calculation is disabled in a region,
then it's only triggered when taxes are calculated manually as explained in
[this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/taxes/storefront/manual-calculation).

#### Example

An example of the general implementation of this method in the Medusa backend's tax calculation strategy:

```ts
async calculate(
  items: LineItem[],
  taxLines: (ShippingMethodTaxLine | LineItemTaxLine)[],
  calculationContext: TaxCalculationContext
): Promise<number> {
  const lineItemsTaxLines = taxLines.filter(
    (tl) => "item_id" in tl
  ) as LineItemTaxLine[]
  const shippingMethodsTaxLines = taxLines.filter(
    (tl) => "shipping_method_id" in tl
  ) as ShippingMethodTaxLine[]

  const lineItemsTax = this.calculateLineItemsTax(
    items,
    lineItemsTaxLines,
    calculationContext
  )

  const shippingMethodsTax = this.calculateShippingMethodsTax(
    calculationContext.shipping_methods,
    shippingMethodsTaxLines
  )

  return Math.round(lineItemsTax + shippingMethodsTax)
}
```
