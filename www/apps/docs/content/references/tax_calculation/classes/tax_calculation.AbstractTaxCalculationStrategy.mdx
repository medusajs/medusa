# How to Override a Tax Calculation Strategy

In this document, you’ll learn how to override the tax calculations strategy in the Medusa backend and the methods you must implement in it.

## Overview

A tax calculation strategy is used to calculate taxes when calculating a cart's totals. The Medusa
backend provides a tax calculation strategy that handles calculating the taxes, taking into account the
defined tax rates and settings such as whether tax-inclusive pricing is enabled.

You can override the tax calculation strategy to implement different calculation logic or to
integrate a third-party service that handles the tax calculation. You can override it either
in a Medusa backend setup or in a plugin.

A tax calculation strategy should be defined in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created under the `src/strategies` directory.
The class must also implement the `ITaxCalculationStrategy` interface imported from the `@medusajs/medusa` package.

For example, you can create the file `src/strategies/tax-calculation.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/strategies/tax-calculation.ts"
import {
  ITaxCalculationStrategy,
  LineItem,
  LineItemTaxLine,
  ShippingMethodTaxLine,
  TaxCalculationContext,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

class TaxCalculationStrategy
  implements ITaxCalculationStrategy {

  async calculate(
    items: LineItem[],
    taxLines: (ShippingMethodTaxLine | LineItemTaxLine)[],
    calculationContext: TaxCalculationContext
  ): Promise<number> {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }

}

export default TaxCalculationStrategy
```

---

## constructor

You can use the `constructor` of your tax calculation strategy to access the different services in Medusa through dependency injection.

You can also use the constructor to initialize your integration with the third-party provider. For example, if you use a client to connect to the third-party provider’s APIs, you can initialize it in the constructor and use it in other methods in the service.
Additionally, if you’re creating your tax calculation strategy as an external plugin to be installed on any Medusa backend and you want to access the options added for the plugin, you can access it in the constructor.

### Example

```ts
import {
  ITaxCalculationStrategy,
  LineItemService,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

type InjectedDependencies = {
  lineItemService: LineItemService
}

class TaxCalculationStrategy
  implements ITaxCalculationStrategy {

  protected readonly lineItemService_: LineItemService

  constructor({ lineItemService }: InjectedDependencies) {
    this.lineItemService_ = lineItemService
  }

  // ...
}

export default TaxCalculationStrategy
```

### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"container","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"An instance of `MedusaContainer` that allows you to access other resources, such as services, in your Medusa backend.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"config","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"If this tax calculation strategy is created in a plugin, the plugin's options are passed in this parameter.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}  sectionTitle="new AbstractTaxCalculationStrategy"/>

## Methods

### calculate

This method calculates the tax amount for a given set of line items under applicable
tax conditions and calculation contexts.

This method is used whenever taxes are calculated. If automatic tax calculation is disabled in a region,
then it's only triggered when taxes are calculated manually as explained in
[this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/taxes/storefront/manual-calculation).

#### Example

An example of the general implementation of this method in the Medusa backend's tax calculation strategy:

```ts
async calculate(
  items: LineItem[],
  taxLines: (ShippingMethodTaxLine | LineItemTaxLine)[],
  calculationContext: TaxCalculationContext
): Promise<number> {
  const lineItemsTaxLines = taxLines.filter(
    (tl) => "item_id" in tl
  ) as LineItemTaxLine[]
  const shippingMethodsTaxLines = taxLines.filter(
    (tl) => "shipping_method_id" in tl
  ) as ShippingMethodTaxLine[]

  const lineItemsTax = this.calculateLineItemsTax(
    items,
    lineItemsTaxLines,
    calculationContext
  )

  const shippingMethodsTax = this.calculateShippingMethodsTax(
    calculationContext.shipping_methods,
    shippingMethodsTaxLines
  )

  return Math.round(lineItemsTax + shippingMethodsTax)
}
```

## Test Implementation

:::note

If you created your tax calculation strategy in a plugin, refer to [this guide on how to test plugins](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/plugins/create#test-your-plugin).

:::

After finishing your tax calculation strategy implementation:

1\. Run the `build` command in the root of your Medusa backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

2\. Start the backend with the `develop` command:

```bash
npx medusa develop
```

3\. To test out your tax calculation strategy implementation, you can [trigger taxes calculation manually](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/taxes/storefront/manual-calculation).
