# Payment Collections

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Payment Collection API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#payment-collections).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

A payment collection is useful for managing additional payments, such as for Order Edits, or installment payments.

## Mutations

### useAdminDeletePaymentCollection

This hook deletes a payment collection. Only payment collections with the statuses `canceled` or `not_paid` can be deleted.

import React from "react"
import { useAdminDeletePaymentCollection } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  paymentCollectionId: string
}

const PaymentCollection = ({ paymentCollectionId }: Props) => {
  const deleteCollection = useAdminDeletePaymentCollection(
    paymentCollectionId
  )
  // ...

  const handleDelete = () => {
    deleteCollection.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ id, object, deleted }) => {
        console.log(id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default PaymentCollection
```

#### Hook Parameters

}

const PaymentCollection = ({ paymentCollectionId }: Props) => {
  const updateCollection = useAdminUpdatePaymentCollection(
    paymentCollectionId
  )
  // ...

  const handleUpdate = (
    description: string
  ) => {
    updateCollection.mutate({
      description
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ payment_collection }) => {

### useAdminMarkPaymentCollectionAsAuthorized

This hook sets the status of a payment collection as `authorized`. This will also change the `authorized_amount` of the payment collection.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminMarkPaymentCollectionAsAuthorized } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  paymentCollectionId: string
}

const PaymentCollection = ({ paymentCollectionId }: Props) => {
  const markAsAuthorized = useAdminMarkPaymentCollectionAsAuthorized(
    paymentCollectionId
  )
  // ...

  const handleAuthorization = () => {
    markAsAuthorized.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ payment_collection }) => {
        console.log(payment_collection.status)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default PaymentCollection
```

#### Hook Parameters
