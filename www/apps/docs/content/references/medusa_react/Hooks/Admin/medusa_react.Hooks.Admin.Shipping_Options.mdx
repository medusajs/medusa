# Shipping Options

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Shipping Option API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-options).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

A shipping option is used to define the available shipping methods during checkout or when creating a return.
Admins can create an unlimited number of shipping options, each associated with a shipping profile and fulfillment provider, among other resources.

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminShippingOptions } from "medusa-react"

const ShippingOptions = () => {
  const {
    shipping_options, 
    isLoading
  } = useAdminShippingOptions()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {shipping_options && !shipping_options.length && (
        <span>No Shipping Options</span>
      )}
      {shipping_options && shipping_options.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
