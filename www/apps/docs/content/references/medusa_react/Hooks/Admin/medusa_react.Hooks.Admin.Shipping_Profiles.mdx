# Shipping Profiles

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Shipping Profile API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-profiles).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

A shipping profile is used to group products that can be shipped in the same manner.
They are created by the admin and they're not associated with a fulfillment provider.
