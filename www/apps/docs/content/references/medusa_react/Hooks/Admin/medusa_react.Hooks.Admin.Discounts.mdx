# Discounts

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Discount API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#discounts).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

Admins can create discounts with conditions and rules, providing them with advanced settings for variety of cases.
The methods in this class can be used to manage discounts, their conditions, resources, and more.

## Mutations

### useAdminAddDiscountConditionResourceBatch

This hook adds a batch of resources to a discount condition. The type of resource depends on the type of discount condition. 
For example, if the discount condition's type is `products`, the resources being added should be products.

#### Example

To add resources to a discount condition:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { 
  useAdminAddDiscountConditionResourceBatch
} from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  discountId: string
  conditionId: string
}

const DiscountCondition = ({
  discountId,
  conditionId
}: Props) => {
  const addConditionResources = useAdminAddDiscountConditionResourceBatch(
    discountId,
    conditionId
  )
  // ...

  const handleAdd = (itemId: string) => {
    addConditionResources.mutate({
      resources: [
        {
          id: itemId
        }
      ]
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ discount }) => {
        console.log(discount.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default DiscountCondition
```

To specify relations to include in the returned discount:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { 
  useAdminAddDiscountConditionResourceBatch
} from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  discountId: string
  conditionId: string
}

const DiscountCondition = ({
  discountId,
  conditionId
}: Props) => {
  const addConditionResources = useAdminAddDiscountConditionResourceBatch(
    discountId,
    conditionId,
    {
      expand: "rule"
    }
  )
  // ...

  const handleAdd = (itemId: string) => {
    addConditionResources.mutate({
      resources: [
        {
          id: itemId
        }
      ]
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ discount }) => {
        console.log(discount.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default DiscountCondition
```

### useAdminDeleteDiscountConditionResourceBatch

This hook remove a batch of resources from a discount condition. This will only remove the association between the resource and 
the discount condition, not the resource itself.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { 
  useAdminDeleteDiscountConditionResourceBatch
} from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  discountId: string
  conditionId: string
}

const DiscountCondition = ({
  discountId,
  conditionId
}: Props) => {
  const deleteConditionResource = useAdminDeleteDiscountConditionResourceBatch(
    discountId,
    conditionId,
  )
  // ...

  const handleDelete = (itemId: string) => {
    deleteConditionResource.mutate({
      resources: [
        {
          id: itemId
        }
      ]
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ discount }) => {
        console.log(discount.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default DiscountCondition
```

### useAdminDiscountRemoveRegion

This hook removes a Region from the list of Regions that a Discount can be used in. 
This does not delete a region, only the association between it and the discount.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDiscountRemoveRegion } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  discountId: string
}

const Discount = ({ discountId }: Props) => {
  const deleteRegion = useAdminDiscountRemoveRegion(discountId)
  // ...

  const handleDelete = (regionId: string) => {
    deleteRegion.mutate(regionId, {
      onSuccess: ({ discount }) => {
        console.log(discount.regions)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default Discount
```

### useAdminCreateDynamicDiscountCode

This hook creates a dynamic unique code that can map to a parent discount. This is useful if you want to 
automatically generate codes with the same rules and conditions.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminCreateDynamicDiscountCode } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  discountId: string
}

const Discount = ({ discountId }: Props) => {
  const createDynamicDiscount = useAdminCreateDynamicDiscountCode(discountId)
  // ...

  const handleCreate = (
    code: string,
    usageLimit: number
  ) => {
    createDynamicDiscount.mutate({
      code,
      usage_limit: usageLimit
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ discount }) => {
        console.log(discount.is_dynamic)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default Discount
```

### useAdminDiscountUpdateCondition

Update a discount condition. Only one of `products`, `product_types`, `product_collections`, `product_tags`, and `customer_groups` 
should be provided in the `payload` parameter, based on the type of discount condition. For example, if the discount condition's 
type is `products`, the `products` field should be provided in the `payload` parameter.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDiscountUpdateCondition } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  discountId: string
  conditionId: string
}

const DiscountCondition = ({
  discountId,
  conditionId
}: Props) => {
  const update = useAdminDiscountUpdateCondition(
    discountId,
    conditionId
  )
  // ...

  const handleUpdate = (
    products: string[]
  ) => {
    update.mutate({
      products
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ discount }) => {
        console.log(discount.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default DiscountCondition

## Queries

### useAdminDiscounts

This hook retrieves a list of Discounts. The discounts can be filtered by fields such as `rule` or `is_dynamic`. 
The discounts can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list discounts:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDiscounts } from "medusa-react"

const Discounts = () => {
  const { discounts, isLoading } = useAdminDiscounts()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {discounts && !discounts.length && (
        <span>No customers</span>
      )}
      {discounts && discounts.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {discounts.map((discount) => (
            <li key={discount.id}>{discount.code}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Discounts
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the discounts:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDiscounts } from "medusa-react"

const Discounts = () => {
  const { discounts, isLoading } = useAdminDiscounts({
    expand: "rule"
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {discounts && !discounts.length && (
        <span>No customers</span>
      )}
      {discounts && discounts.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {discounts.map((discount) => (
            <li key={discount.id}>{discount.code}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Discounts
```

By default, only the first `20` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminDiscounts } from "medusa-react"

const Discounts = () => {
  const { 
    discounts, 
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useAdminDiscounts({
    expand: "rule",
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {discounts && !discounts.length && (
        <span>No customers</span>
      )}
      {discounts && discounts.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {discounts.map((discount) => (
            <li key={discount.id}>{discount.code}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Discounts
```
