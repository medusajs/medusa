# Notifications

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Notification API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#notifications).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

Notifications are sent to customers to inform them of new updates. For example, a notification can be sent to the customer when their order is place or its state is updated.
The notification's type, such as an email or SMS, is determined by the notification provider installed on the Medusa backend.

## Mutations

### useAdminResendNotification

This hook resends a previously sent notifications, with the same data but optionally to a different address.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminResendNotification } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  notificationId: string
}

const Notification = ({ notificationId }: Props) => {
  const resendNotification = useAdminResendNotification(
    notificationId
  )
  // ...

  const handleResend = () => {
    resendNotification.mutate({}, {
      onSuccess: ({ notification }) => {
        console.log(notification.id)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default Notification
```

## Queries

### useAdminNotifications

This hook retrieves a list of notifications. The notifications can be filtered by fields such as `event_name` or `resource_type` passed in the `query` parameter.
The notifications can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list notifications:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminNotifications } from "medusa-react"

const Notifications = () => {
  const { notifications, isLoading } = useAdminNotifications()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {notifications && !notifications.length && (
        <span>No Notifications</span>
      )}
      {notifications && notifications.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {notifications.map((notification) => (
            <li key={notification.id}>{notification.to}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Notifications
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the notifications:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminNotifications } from "medusa-react"

const Notifications = () => {
  const { notifications, isLoading } = useAdminNotifications({
    expand: "provider"
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {notifications && !notifications.length && (
        <span>No Notifications</span>
      )}
      {notifications && notifications.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {notifications.map((notification) => (
            <li key={notification.id}>{notification.to}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Notifications
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminNotifications } from "medusa-react"

const Notifications = () => {
  const { 
    notifications, 
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useAdminNotifications({
    expand: "provider",
    limit: 20,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {notifications && !notifications.length && (
        <span>No Notifications</span>
      )}
      {notifications && notifications.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {notifications.map((notification) => (
            <li key={notification.id}>{notification.to}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Notifications
```
