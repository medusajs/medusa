# Order Edits

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Order Edit API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#order-edits).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

An admin can edit an order to remove, add, or update an item's quantity. When an admin edits an order, they're stored as an `OrderEdit`.

### useAdminOrderEditDeleteLineItem

This hook creates a line item change in the order edit that indicates deleting an item in the original order. 
The item in the original order will not be deleted until the order edit is confirmed.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrderEditDeleteLineItem } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderEditId: string
  itemId: string
}

const OrderEditLineItem = ({
  orderEditId,
  itemId
}: Props) => {
  const removeLineItem = useAdminOrderEditDeleteLineItem(
    orderEditId, 
    itemId
  )
  
  const handleRemoveLineItem = () => {
    removeLineItem.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ order_edit }) => {
        console.log(order_edit.changes)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default OrderEditLineItem
```

### useAdminOrderEditAddLineItem

This hook creates a line item change in the order edit that indicates adding an item in the original order. 
The item will not be added to the original order until the order edit is confirmed.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrderEditAddLineItem } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderEditId: string
}

const OrderEdit = ({ orderEditId }: Props) => {
  const addLineItem = useAdminOrderEditAddLineItem(
    orderEditId
  )

  const handleAddLineItem = 
    (quantity: number, variantId: string) => {
      addLineItem.mutate({
        quantity,
        variant_id: variantId,
      }, {
        onSuccess: ({ order_edit }) => {
          console.log(order_edit.changes)
        }
      })
    }
  
  // ...
}

export default OrderEdit

### useAdminRequestOrderEditConfirmation

This hook requests customer confirmation of an order edit. This would emit the event `order-edit.requested` which Notification Providers listen to and send
a notification to the customer about the order edit.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { 
  useAdminRequestOrderEditConfirmation,
} from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderEditId: string
}

const OrderEdit = ({ orderEditId }: Props) => {
  const requestOrderConfirmation = 
    useAdminRequestOrderEditConfirmation(
      orderEditId
    )
  
  const handleRequestConfirmation = () => {
    requestOrderConfirmation.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ order_edit }) => {
        console.log(
          order_edit.requested_at, 
          order_edit.requested_by
        )
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default OrderEdit
```

    orderEditId
  )
  
  const handleConfirmOrderEdit = () => {
    confirmOrderEdit.mutate(void 0, {
      onSuccess: ({ order_edit }) => {
        console.log(
          order_edit.confirmed_at,
          order_edit.confirmed_by
        )
      }

## Queries

### useAdminOrderEdit

This hook retrieves an order edit's details.

#### Example

A simple example that retrieves an order edit by its ID:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrderEdit } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderEditId: string
}

const OrderEdit = ({ orderEditId }: Props) => {
  const { 
    order_edit, 
    isLoading, 
  } = useAdminOrderEdit(orderEditId)

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {order_edit && <span>{order_edit.status}</span>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default OrderEdit
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrderEdit } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  orderEditId: string
}

const OrderEdit = ({ orderEditId }: Props) => {
  const { 
    order_edit, 
    isLoading, 
  } = useAdminOrderEdit(
    orderEditId,
    {
      expand: "order"
    }
  )

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {order_edit && <span>{order_edit.status}</span>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default OrderEdit

### useAdminOrderEdits

This hook retrieves a list of order edits. The order edits can be filtered by fields such as `q` or `order_id` passed to the `query` parameter. 
The order edits can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list order edits:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrderEdits } from "medusa-react"

const OrderEdits = () => {
  const { order_edits, isLoading } = useAdminOrderEdits()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {order_edits && !order_edits.length && (
        <span>No Order Edits</span>
      )}
      {order_edits && order_edits.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {order_edits.map((orderEdit) => (
            <li key={orderEdit.id}>
              {orderEdit.status}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default OrderEdits
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the order edits:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrderEdits } from "medusa-react"

const OrderEdits = () => {
  const { order_edits, isLoading } = useAdminOrderEdits({
    expand: "order"
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {order_edits && !order_edits.length && (
        <span>No Order Edits</span>
      )}
      {order_edits && order_edits.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {order_edits.map((orderEdit) => (
            <li key={orderEdit.id}>
              {orderEdit.status}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default OrderEdits
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminOrderEdits } from "medusa-react"

const OrderEdits = () => {
  const { 
    order_edits,
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useAdminOrderEdits({
    expand: "order",
    limit: 20,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {order_edits && !order_edits.length && (
        <span>No Order Edits</span>
      )}
      {order_edits && order_edits.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {order_edits.map((orderEdit) => (
            <li key={orderEdit.id}>
              {orderEdit.status}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default OrderEdits
```
