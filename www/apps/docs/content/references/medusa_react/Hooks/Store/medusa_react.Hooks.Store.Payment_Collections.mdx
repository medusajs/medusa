# Payment Collections

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Store Payment Collection API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#payment-collections).

A payment collection is useful for managing additional payments, such as for Order Edits, or installment payments.

## Mutations

### useManageMultiplePaymentSessions

This hook creates, updates, or deletes a list of payment sessions of a Payment Collections. If a payment session is not provided in the `sessions` array, it's deleted.

#### Example

To add two new payment sessions:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useManageMultiplePaymentSessions } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  paymentCollectionId: string
}

const PaymentCollection = ({
  paymentCollectionId
}: Props) => {
  const managePaymentSessions = useManageMultiplePaymentSessions(
    paymentCollectionId
  )

  const handleManagePaymentSessions = () => {
    managePaymentSessions.mutate({
      // Total amount = 10000
      sessions: [
        {
          provider_id: "stripe",
          amount: 5000,
        },
        {
          provider_id: "manual",
          amount: 5000,
        },
      ]
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ payment_collection }) => {
        console.log(payment_collection.payment_sessions)
      }
    })
  }
  
  // ...
}

export default PaymentCollection
```

To update a payment session and another one by not including it in the payload:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useManageMultiplePaymentSessions } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  paymentCollectionId: string
}

const PaymentCollection = ({
  paymentCollectionId
}: Props) => {
  const managePaymentSessions = useManageMultiplePaymentSessions(
    paymentCollectionId
  )

  const handleManagePaymentSessions = () => {
    managePaymentSessions.mutate({
      // Total amount = 10000
      sessions: [
        {
          provider_id: "stripe",
          amount: 10000,
          session_id: "ps_123456"
        },
      ]
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ payment_collection }) => {
        console.log(payment_collection.payment_sessions)
      }
    })
  }
  
  // ...
}

export default PaymentCollection
```
