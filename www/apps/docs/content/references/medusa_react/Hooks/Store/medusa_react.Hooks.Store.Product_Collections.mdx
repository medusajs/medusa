# Product Collections

Queries listed here are used to send requests to the [Store Product Collection API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#product-collections).

A product collection is used to organize products for different purposes such as marketing or discount purposes. For example, you can create a Summer Collection.
Using the methods in this class, you can list or retrieve a collection's details and products.

## Queries

### useCollection

This hook retrieves a product collection's details.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useCollection } from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  collectionId: string
}

const ProductCollection = ({ collectionId }: Props) => {
  const { collection, isLoading } = useCollection(collectionId)

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {collection && <span>{collection.title}</span>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default ProductCollection
```

### useCollections

This hook retrieves a list of product collections. The product collections can be filtered by fields such as `handle` or `created_at` passed in the `query` parameter. 
The product collections can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list product collections:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useCollections } from "medusa-react"

const ProductCollections = () => {
  const { collections, isLoading } = useCollections()

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {collections && collections.length === 0 && (
        <span>No Product Collections</span>
      )}
      {collections && collections.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {collections.map((collection) => (
            <li key={collection.id}>{collection.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default ProductCollections
```

By default, only the first `10` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useCollections } from "medusa-react"

const ProductCollections = () => {
  const { 
    collections, 
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useCollections({
    limit: 20,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {collections && collections.length === 0 && (
        <span>No Product Collections</span>
      )}
      {collections && collections.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {collections.map((collection) => (
            <li key={collection.id}>{collection.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default ProductCollections
```
