# listAndCountPriceRules - Pricing Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listAndCountPriceRules` method. This belongs to the Pricing Module.

This method is used to retrieve a paginated list of price rules along with the total count of available price rules satisfying the provided filters.

## Example

To retrieve a list of price rules using their IDs:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceRules (id: string) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceRules, count] = await pricingService.listAndCountPriceRules({
    id: [id]
  })

  // do something with the price rules or return them
}
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the price rules:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceRules (id: string) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceRules, count] = await pricingService.listAndCountPriceRules({
    id: [id],
  }, {
    relations: ["price_set"]
  })

  // do something with the price rules or return them
}
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceRules (id: string, skip: number, take: number) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceRules, count] = await pricingService.listAndCountPriceRules({
    id: [id],
  }, {
    relations: ["price_set"],
    skip,
    take
  })

  // do something with the price rules or return them
}
```

You can also use the `$and` or `$or` properties of the `filter` parameter to use and/or conditions in your filters. For example:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceRules (ids: string[], name: string[], skip: number, take: number) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceRules, count] = await pricingService.listAndCountPriceRules({
    $and: [
      {
        id: ids
      },
      {
        name
      }
    ]
  }, {
    relations: ["price_set"],
    skip,
    take
  })

  // do something with the price rules or return them
}
```
