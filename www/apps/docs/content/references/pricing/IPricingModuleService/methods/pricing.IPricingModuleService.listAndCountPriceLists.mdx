# listAndCountPriceLists - Pricing Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listAndCountPriceLists` method. This belongs to the Pricing Module.

This method is used to retrieve a paginated list of price lists along with the total count of available price lists satisfying the provided filters.

## Example

To retrieve a list of price lists using their IDs:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceLists (priceListIds: string[]) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceLists, count] = await pricingService.listPriceLists(
    {
      id: priceListIds
    },
  )

  // do something with the price lists or return them
}
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the price lists:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceLists (priceListIds: string[]) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceLists, count] = await pricingService.listPriceLists(
    {
      id: priceListIds
    },
    {
      relations: ["price_set_money_amounts"]
    }
  )

  // do something with the price lists or return them
}
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceLists (priceListIds: string[], skip: number, take: number) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceLists, count] = await pricingService.listPriceLists(
    {
      id: priceListIds
    },
    {
      relations: ["price_set_money_amounts"],
      skip,
      take
    }
  )

  // do something with the price lists or return them
}
```

You can also use the `$and` or `$or` properties of the `filter` parameter to use and/or conditions in your filters. For example:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function retrievePriceLists (priceListIds: string[], titles: string[], skip: number, take: number) {
  const pricingService = await initializePricingModule()

  const [priceLists, count] = await pricingService.listPriceLists(
    {
      $and: [
        {
          id: priceListIds
        },
        {
          title: titles
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      relations: ["price_set_money_amounts"],
      skip,
      take
    }
  )

  // do something with the price lists or return them
}
```
