are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.admin.orderEdits` property.

### list

Retrieve a list of order edits. The order edits can be filtered by fields such as `q` or `order_id` passed to the `query` parameter. The order edits can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list order edits:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.orderEdits.list()
.then(({ order_edits, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(order_edits.length)
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the order edits:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.orderEdits.list({
  expand: "order"
})
.then(({ order_edits, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(order_edits.length)
})
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.orderEdits.list({
  expand: "order",
  limit,
  offset
})
.then(({ order_edits, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(order_edits.length)
})
```

### updateLineItem

Create or update a line item change in the order edit that indicates addition, deletion, or update of a line item into an original order. Line item changes
are only reflected on the original order after the order edit is confirmed.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.orderEdits.updateLineItem(orderEditId, lineItemId, {
  quantity: 5
})
.then(({ order_edit }) => {
  console.log(order_edit.id)
})
```
