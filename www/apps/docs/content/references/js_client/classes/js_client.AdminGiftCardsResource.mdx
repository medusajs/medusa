# AdminGiftCardsResource

This class is used to send requests to [Admin Gift Card API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#gift-cards). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.admin.giftCards` property.

All methods in this class require [user authentication](js_client.AdminAuthResource.mdx#createsession).

Admins can create gift cards and send them directly to customers, specifying options like their balance, region, and more.
These gift cards are different than the saleable gift cards in a store, which are created and managed through [AdminProductsResource](js_client.AdminProductsResource.mdx).

### list

Retrieve a list of gift cards. The gift cards can be filtered by fields such as `q` passed in the `query` parameter. The gift cards can also paginated.

#### Example

To list gift cards:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.giftCards.list()
.then(({ gift_cards, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(gift_cards.length);
})
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.giftCards.list({
  limit,
  offset
})
.then(({ gift_cards, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(gift_cards.length);
})
```
