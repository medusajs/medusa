### createDynamicCode

Create a dynamic unique code that can map to a parent discount. This is useful if you want to automatically generate codes with the same rules and conditions.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.createDynamicCode(discountId, {
  code: "TEST",
  usage_limit: 1
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```

### list

Retrieve a list of Discounts. The discounts can be filtered by fields such as `rule` or `is_dynamic`. The discounts can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list discounts:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.list()
.then(({ discounts, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(discounts.id);
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the discounts:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.list({
  expand: "rule"
})
.then(({ discounts, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(discounts.id);
})
```

By default, only the first `20` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.list({
  expand: "rule",
  limit,
  offset
})
.then(({ discounts, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(discounts.id);
})
```

### removeRegion

Remove a Region from the list of Regions that a Discount can be used in. This does not delete a region, only the association between it and the discount.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.removeRegion(discountId, regionId)
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```

### createCondition

Create a discount condition. Only one of `products`, `product_types`, `product_collections`, `product_tags`, and `customer_groups` should be provided in the `payload` parameter,
based on the type of discount condition. For example, if the discount condition's type is `products`, the `products` field should be provided in the `payload` parameter.

#### Example

To create a condition in a discount:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
import { DiscountConditionOperator } from "@medusajs/medusa"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.createCondition(discountId, {
  operator: DiscountConditionOperator.IN,
  products: [productId]
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved as part of the response:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
import { DiscountConditionOperator } from "@medusajs/medusa"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.createCondition(discountId, {
  operator: DiscountConditionOperator.IN,
  products: [productId]
}, {
  expand: "rule"
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```

### updateCondition

Update a discount condition. Only one of `products`, `product_types`, `product_collections`, `product_tags`, and `customer_groups` should be provided in the `payload` parameter,
based on the type of discount condition. For example, if the discount condition's type is `products`, the `products` field should be provided in the `payload` parameter.

#### Example

To update a condition in a discount:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.updateCondition(discountId, conditionId, {
  products: [
    productId
  ]
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved as part of the response:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.updateCondition(discountId, conditionId, {
  products: [
    productId
  ]
}, {
  expand: "rule"
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```

### deleteCondition

Delete a discount condition. This doesn't delete resources associated to the discount condition.

#### Example

```ts

### addConditionResourceBatch

Add a batch of resources to a discount condition. The type of resource depends on the type of discount condition. For example, if the discount condition's type is `products`,
the resources being added should be products.

#### Example

To add resources to a discount condition:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.addConditionResourceBatch(discountId, conditionId, {
  resources: [{ id: itemId }]
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```

To specify relations to include in the returned discount:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.addConditionResourceBatch(discountId, conditionId, {
  resources: [{ id: itemId }]
}, {
  expand: "rule"
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})

### deleteConditionResourceBatch

Remove a batch of resources from a discount condition. This will only remove the association between the resource and the discount condition, not the resource itself.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.discounts.deleteConditionResourceBatch(discountId, conditionId, {
  resources: [{ id: itemId }]
})
.then(({ discount }) => {
  console.log(discount.id);
})
```
