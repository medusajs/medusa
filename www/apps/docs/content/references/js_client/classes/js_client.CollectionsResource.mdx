This class is used to send requests to [Store Product Collection API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#product-collections). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.collections` property.

### list

Retrieve a list of product collections. The product collections can be filtered by fields such as `handle` or `created_at` passed in the `query` parameter. 
The product collections can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list product collections:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.collections.list()
.then(({ collections, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(collections.length);
})
```

By default, only the first `10` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.collections.list({
  limit,
  offset
})
.then(({ collections, limit, offset, count }) => {
  console.log(collections.length);
})
```
