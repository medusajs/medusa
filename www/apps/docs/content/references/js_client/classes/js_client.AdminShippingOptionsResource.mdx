This class is used to send requests to [Admin Shipping Option API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-options). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.admin.shippingOptions` property.

All methods in this class require [user authentication](js_client.AdminAuthResource.mdx#createsession).

A shipping option is used to define the available shipping methods during checkout or when creating a return.
Admins can create an unlimited number of shipping options, each associated with a shipping profile and fulfillment provider, among other resources.
