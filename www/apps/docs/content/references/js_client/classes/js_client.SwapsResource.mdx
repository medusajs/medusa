# SwapsResource

This class is used to send requests to [Store Swap API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#swaps). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.swaps` property.

A swap is created by a customer or an admin to exchange an item with a new one.
Creating a swap implicitely includes creating a return for the item being exchanged.

## Methods

### create

Create a Swap for an Order. This will also create a return and associate it with the swap. If a return shipping option is specified, the return will automatically be fulfilled.
To complete the swap, you must use the [CartsResource.complete](js_client.CartsResource.mdx#complete) method passing it the ID of the swap's cart.

An idempotency key will be generated if none is provided in the header `Idempotency-Key` and added to
the response. If an error occurs during swap creation or the request is interrupted for any reason, the swap creation can be retried by passing the idempotency
key in the `Idempotency-Key` header.

#### Example

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
medusa.swaps.create({
  order_id,
  return_items: [
    {
      item_id,
      quantity: 1
    }
  ],
  additional_items: [
    {
      variant_id,
      quantity: 1
    }
  ]
})
.then(({ swap }) => {
  console.log(swap.id);
})
```
