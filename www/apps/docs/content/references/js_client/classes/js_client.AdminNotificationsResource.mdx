# AdminNotificationsResource

This class is used to send requests to [Admin Notification API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#notifications). All its method
are available in the JS Client under the `medusa.admin.notifications` property.

All methods in this class require [user authentication](js_client.AdminAuthResource.mdx#createsession).

Notifications are sent to customers to inform them of new updates. For example, a notification can be sent to the customer when their order is place or its state is updated.
The notification's type, such as an email or SMS, is determined by the notification provider installed on the Medusa backend.

## Methods

### list

Retrieve a list of notifications. The notifications can be filtered by fields such as `event_name` or `resource_type` passed in the `query` parameter.
The notifications can also be paginated.

#### Example

To list notifications:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.notifications.list()
.then(({ notifications }) => {
  console.log(notifications.length);
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the notifications:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.notifications.list({
  expand: "provider"
})
.then(({ notifications }) => {
  console.log(notifications.length);
})
```

By default, only the first `50` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```ts
import Medusa from "@medusajs/medusa-js"
const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 })
// must be previously logged in or use api token
medusa.admin.notifications.list({
  expand: "provider",
  limit,
  offset
})
.then(({ notifications }) => {
  console.log(notifications.length);
})
```
