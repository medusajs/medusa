# softDeleteVariants - Product Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the softDeleteVariants method. This belongs to the Product Module.

This method is used to delete variants. Unlike the [delete](product.IProductModuleService.delete.mdx) method, this method won't completely remove the variant. It can still be accessed or retrieved using methods like [retrieve](product.IProductModuleService.retrieve.mdx) if you pass the `withDeleted` property to the `config` object parameter.

The soft-deleted variants can be restored using the [restore](product.IProductModuleService.restore.mdx) method.

## Example

```ts
await productModuleService.softDeleteVariants([
  "variant_123",
  "variant_321",
])
```
