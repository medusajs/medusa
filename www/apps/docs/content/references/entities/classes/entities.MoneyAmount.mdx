# MoneyAmount

A Money Amount represent a price amount, for example, a product variant's price or a price in a price list. Each Money Amount either has a Currency or Region associated with it to indicate the pricing in a given Currency or, for fully region-based pricing, the given price in a specific Region. If region-based pricing is used, the amount will be in the currency defined for the Region.
