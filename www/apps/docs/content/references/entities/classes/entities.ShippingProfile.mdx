# ShippingProfile

A Shipping Profile has a set of defined Shipping Options that can be used to fulfill a given set of Products. For example, gift cards are shipped differently than physical products, so a shipping profile with the type `gift\_card` groups together the shipping options that can only be used for gift cards.
