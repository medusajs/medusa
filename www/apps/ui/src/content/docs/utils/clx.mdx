## Usage
---

The `clx` function is a utility function for working with classNames. It is built using [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) and [tw-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tw-merge) and is intended to be used with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

```tsx
import { clx } from "@medusajs/ui"

type BoxProps = {
  className?: string
  children: React.ReactNode
  mt: "sm" | "md" | "lg"
}

const Box = ({ className, children, mt }: BoxProps) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={clx(
        "flex items-center justify-center",
        {
          "mt-4": mt === "sm",
          "mt-8": mt === "md",
          "mt-12": mt === "lg",
        },
        className
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

```

In the above example the utility is used to apply a base style, a margin top that is dependent on the `mt` prop and a custom className.
The Box component accepts a `className` prop that is merged with the other classNames, and the underlying usage of `tw-merge` ensures that all Tailwind CSS classes are merged without style conflicts.
