Welcome to Medusa UI, a React implementation of the Medusa design system.
It is a collection of components, hooks, utility functions, icons, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes that can be used to build
a consistent user interface across the Medusa Admin and other Medusa applications.

## About

---

At its core, Medusa UI is a styled and slightly opinionated implementation of [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives).
Our team have also referenced the fantastic [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for inspiration in certain implementations.

Our team strongly believe in keeping the components simple and
composable, much like Medusa's foundation. This allows you to build whatever you need. Our team have tried to avoid overloading
the component API and, instead, leveraged the native HTML API, which gets implemented
and respected accordingly, and passed to the underlying elements.
